Here is your **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 5**, focused on:

- **Data Interpretation (DI):** tables, bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts  
- Continuous light revision of **core arithmetic** (percentages, ratios, averages, P&L, SI/CI, TSD, Time & Work)  
- Building **speed + accuracy** on reading data and calculating quickly

Assume ~**2.5–3 hours/day**. Structure:

> Learn format → Study 1–2 guided examples → Solve on your own → Timed mini-sets → Reflect.

---

## Day 1 – DI with Tables: Reading & Basic Calculations

**Main goal:** Get comfortable extracting data from tables and doing simple % and ratio calculations from them.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Learn what typical DI tables look like:

- Rows = categories (e.g., Years, Products, Departments)  
- Columns = metrics (e.g., Sales, Profit, % growth)

Key skills:

1. **Read labels carefully**  
   - Is the unit “thousands”, “lakhs”, or actual numbers?  
   - Is the table giving totals, or per-item values?

2. **Basic questions types from tables**  
   - Direct lookup: “What is value for 2018?”  
   - Row/column sums: “Total sales over 3 years?”  
   - Differences: “Increase from 2017 to 2018?”  
   - Ratios: “Sales of A vs B?”

3. **Use mental math where possible**  
   - For sums and simple differences, avoid long written steps.  
   - Approximate when asked for nearest %, etc.

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Take 1–2 small tables (e.g., “Sales of 3 products over 4 years”) and work through:

For each table, answer:

1. Direct reading:
   - “What are sales of Product A in 2019?”  
   - “Highest sales year for Product B?”

2. Add/subtract:
   - “Total sales of all products in 2018?”  
   - “Difference between 2017 and 2019 for Product C?”

3. Ratios & simple % from table:
   - “What is the ratio of A’s total sales to B’s total sales (over all years)?”  
   - “What % of total 2019 sales was from Product C?”

Write all steps explicitly at first, then see where mental shortcuts are safe.

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner (35–45 min)

Solve **3–4 DI table sets**, each with 3–5 questions (total ~12–16 Q).

Types:
- At least 1 very basic table (direct lookup).  
- At least 1 that requires you to sum across years/products.  
- At least 1 that uses ratios and percentages.

For now:
- Don’t time yourself strictly; focus on **accuracy and careful reading**.  
- Underline or circle:
  - Units (e.g., thousands, crores).  
  - “Per month” vs “per year” etc.

### 4. Quick Arithmetic Revision (15–20 min)

From earlier weeks, do **8–10 quick questions** (no deep thinking):

- 3 from percentages/ratios.  
- 3 from averages or P&L.  
- 2–4 from SI/CI or TSD.

This keeps your arithmetic sharp for DI calculations.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:

- Did you misread any table heading or units?  
- Did any question take long just because of messy addition/subtraction?  
- One thing you’ll do tomorrow to read tables faster (e.g., “always scan rows/columns for a few seconds before answering”).

---

## Day 2 – DI with Bar Graphs & Stacked Bars

**Main goal:** Learn to read bar graphs comparing categories/years and perform core calculations.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Understand:

1. **Bar graphs**  
   - X-axis: categories (e.g., years, products).  
   - Y-axis: scale (values).  
   - Single bar per category → simple comparison.  
   - Double bar per category → compare two series per category (e.g., Males/Females, Sales/Profit).

2. Skills needed:
   - Estimating bar heights from scale.  
   - Reading legends (what each color/pattern represents).  
   - Handling questions like:
     - “In which year is the difference maximum between A and B?”  
     - “Total of A over all years?”

3. **Approximation**  
   - If graph values not exact integer (e.g., 42.5), approximate if question allows “nearest integer/percent”.

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Take 2 bar graphs (find from any aptitude source):

- Graph 1: Single bar per category (e.g., “Sales over 5 years”).  
- Graph 2: Double bar (e.g., “Sales of Company A and B over 5 years”).

For each:

1. Read axis labels and units.  
2. Answer:
   - Which year has maximum value?  
   - What is % increase from year X to Y?  
   - What is total over years?  
   - For double-bar: difference between A and B in each year; in which year is gap largest?

Write short, neat working. This is training interpretation + arithmetic.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **3–4 bar graph sets** (~12–16 Q):

- 1 simple single-bar graph.  
- 1 double-bar comparison graph.  
- If possible, 1 “stacked bar” or comparative allocation graph.

Target questions involving:
- Max/min value.  
- Year-over-year change.  
- Ratios between categories.  
- Sum/average over categories or years.

### 4. Timed Mini-set (15–20 min)

Pick **1 bar graph set (4–5 questions)** and:

- Set a **12–15 minute** timer.  
- Try to answer all without panicking.

Afterwards:
- Note if you ran out of time.  
- For slow questions, ask: Was it reading or calculation slowing you?

### 5. Quick Arithmetic Revision (10–15 min)

- 5 mental % and ratio questions like:
  - “What is 22% of 450?”  
  - “Ratio of 180:240 simplified?”  
- 2–3 mini average problems.

---

## Day 3 – DI with Line Graphs & Trend Analysis

**Main goal:** Read trends over time and do comparisons based on line graphs.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Line graph basics:

1. X-axis often = time (years, months).  
2. Y-axis = quantities (sales, production, etc.).  
3. Points connected with lines show **trend**, not necessarily straight change between points.

Question types:
- Direct read: value in year X.  
- Increase/decrease between years.  
- Average over several years.  
- Identifying:
  - “In which year is rate of increase highest?”  
  - “Between which years did value decrease?”

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Take 1–2 line graphs:

Graph 1: Single line (e.g., profits over 6 years).  
Graph 2: Two lines (e.g., Company A and B).

Practice:

1. Identify:
   - Year with highest value.  
   - Year with lowest value.  
   - Between which years value increased most (largest vertical jump).

2. Compute:
   - Total over a range of years.  
   - Average over given years.  
   - % increase from first year to last.

3. For two-line graph:
   - In which years does A > B?  
   - When is gap largest?

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **3–4 line graph sets** (~12–16 Q):

- At least 1 single-line trend.  
- At least 1 double-line comparison.

Ensure you handle both:
- Direct reading and arithmetic.  
- Conceptual questions about growth or decline.

### 4. Timed Set + Mini Mix (20–25 min)

1. **Timed line-graph set**  
   - Choose 1 line-graph set (4–5 Q).  
   - Time: **12–15 minutes**.

2. **Mini mixed DI** (if time allows, 1 short set)  
   - Could be table or bar-graph with 3–4 questions.  
   - No strict timer, but aim for ~10 minutes.

### 5. Quick Concept Check (10–15 min)

Orally/mentally answer:

- How is DI with line graphs different from bar graphs?  
- When you see “rate of increase,” what do you compute?  
- How will you cross-check calculations when values are close (to avoid reading error)?

---

## Day 4 – DI with Pie Charts: Percentages of a Whole

**Main goal:** Use your percentages/ratios to analyze pie charts efficiently.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Pie chart basics:

1. Whole circle = 360° or 100% or total value.  
2. Each sector = portion corresponding to category.  
3. Often given as:
   - Degrees (e.g., 90° = 25% of total).  
   - Direct % (e.g., “Segment A = 20%”).

Key conversions:
- Degree → %: (degree / 360) × 100.  
- % → degree: (% / 100) × 360.  
- To find category value:  
  - Category value = Total × (angle/360) or Total × (%/100).

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Use 1–2 pie charts:

Case 1: Pie chart with percentage labels.  
- Total expenditure = ₹40,000, categories with 20%, 25%, etc.

Answer:
- How much spent on category X?  
- Which category has highest/lowest share?  
- If total increases by 10%, new amount for category Y?

Case 2: Pie chart with angle labels.  
- Total students = 720, sectors 72°, 108°, etc.

Answer:
- Number of students in each sector.  
- Ratio of students in two sectors.  
- Combined % for two categories.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **3–4 pie-chart sets** (~12–16 Q):

Mix:
- Charts with % given.  
- Charts with angles given.  

Questions should involve:
- Direct value from total & percentage.  
- Ratios between sectors.  
- Combined sectors (sum of two or more categories).  
- Changes when total increases/decreases by some %.

### 4. Timed Pie Chart Set (15–20 min)

Pick **1 pie-chart set** (4–5 questions):

- Time: **12–15 minutes**.  
- Focus on:
  - Fast fraction/percentage calculations.  
  - Not over-writing; keep working neat.

### 5. Arithmetic Drill + Reflection (15–20 min)

1. **Arithmetic drill (10–12 min)**  
   - 10%/20%/25%/33.33%/12.5% of random totals (e.g., 3600, 7200, 5400, etc.).  
   - This simulates pie-chart processing.

2. **Reflection (5–8 min)**  
   - Are you turning % into amounts quickly?  
   - Do you visualize the whole = 360° or 100% clearly before diving into answers?

---

## Day 5 – Mixed DI: Tables + Graphs + Pie Charts (Untimed First)

**Main goal:** Integrate all DI forms and strengthen logical reading.

### 1. Quick Recap (15–20 min)

On a blank page, from memory, write:

- Steps for solving a table DI set.  
- For bar/line graphs: what to check first (axes, units, legend).  
- For pie charts: main formulas for converting % or degrees to values.

Then briefly check notes and correct yourself.

### 2. Mixed DI Set 1 – Untimed (35–45 min)

Choose **2–3 DI sets** of different types (total ~15–18 questions):

- 1 table.  
- 1 bar or line graph.  
- 1 pie chart (if time permits).

Goal:
- Move **slowly and accurately**, not worrying about time yet.  
- For each question:
  - Underline the key phrases (e.g., “combined for all years”, “percentage of total”, “difference between”).  
  - Write small annotations on the diagram/table if needed (e.g., row totals, difference each year).

### 3. Mixed DI Set 2 – Slightly Timed (25–30 min)

Choose **2 more sets** (around 8–10 questions total):

- Set timer for **25–30 minutes**.  
- Try to move with a bit more urgency:
  - Don’t re-read the entire graph each time.  
  - Reuse intermediate computations (like year totals) across multiple questions.

After time is up:
- Mark which questions felt slow or confusing.

### 4. Light Core-Quant Revision (15–20 min)

From Weeks 1–4, do **8–10 quick problems**:

- 2 from Percentages/Ratios.  
- 2 from Averages.  
- 2 from P&L or SI/CI.  
- 2 from TSD or Time & Work.

Keep them easy/moderate; aim to solve more or less mentally.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:

- Which DI format do you now find easiest? hardest?  
- Do you often recompute the same sum multiple times? If yes, tomorrow try to **write a tiny table of useful intermediate totals/sums** and reuse them.

---

## Day 6 – DI Under Time Pressure + Integrated Quant

**Main goal:** Solve mixed DI nearly at exam speed and integrate older quant topics.

### 1. Short Review (10–15 min)

Glance over notes from past 4 days:

- Remind yourself:
  - For tables: total = row/column sums.  
  - For graphs: watch units and legends.  
  - For pie: total & %/angle relation.

Don’t dwell; just refresh.

### 2. Timed DI Section Simulation (35–40 min)

Prepare/choose **3 DI sets** (mix types), about **12–15 questions total**.

- Types:
  - 1 table with 4–5 questions.  
  - 1 bar or line graph with 4–5 questions.  
  - 1 pie or mixed chart with 4–5 questions.

Set a **35–40 minute** timer. Conditions:

- Single sitting, no solutions in between.  
- Aim for **accuracy first**, but keep an eye on the time.  
- If a question looks very calculation-heavy or confusing, **mark and skip**, return later if time remains.

Afterwards, quickly count:
- Attempted questions.  
- How many you guessed.

### 3. Error Review (25–30 min)

Now, with no timer:

1. Check answers.  
2. For each wrong or skipped question:
   - Identify:  
     - Misread?  
     - Wrong arithmetic?  
     - Wrong logic (e.g., wrong total)?  
   - Re-solve slowly and correctly.

3. If you see a pattern (e.g., “I always mess up % change questions in DI”), note it and decide:
   - “I will practice 5 more DI %-change questions tomorrow.”

### 4. Mini Mixed Quant (15–20 min)

Do a **small, non-DI** set of **8–10 questions**:

- Mix from: P&L, SI/CI, TSD, Time & Work, Number Systems.  
- Give yourself ~15–20 min.

This maintains your overall aptitude skill while DI is in focus.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:

- Did you feel rushed in the DI timed section?  
- Where did you lose the most time: reading or calculations?  
- One workaround you’ll try tomorrow (e.g., rough column/row sums in one go, pre-computing totals).

---

## Day 7 – Week 5 Mini Mock (DI-focused) + Consolidation

**Main goal:** Simulate a full DI-heavy section plus some general quant, then analyze.

### 1. Light Warm-up (10–15 min)

Warm up with **4–5 quick questions**:

- 1 table DI question (easy).  
- 1 bar/line graph question.  
- 1 pie chart question.  
- 1 % or ratio question.  
- 1 short P&L or SI/CI question.

This is just to get your brain into “calculation + interpretation” mode.

### 2. Week 5 Mini Mock (45–50 min)

Design/choose a small mock:

- **DI (20 questions total)**  
  - 1 table set (4–6 Q)  
  - 1 bar graph set (4–5 Q)  
  - 1 line graph set (4–5 Q)  
  - 1 pie chart set (4–6 Q)
- **General Quant (5 questions)**  
  - Mix from Percentages, Averages, P&L, Time & Work, or TSD.

Total: **25 questions**.

Rules:

- Time limit: **45–50 minutes**, uninterrupted.  
- Strict: no checking solutions mid-way.  
- Try to simulate exam environment (quiet, phone away).

Strategy:

- Quickly scan all sets (10–15 seconds each) to see which appears easiest.  
- Start with your strongest DI type.  
- If any question looks messy, leave and come back if time permits.

### 3. Mock Analysis (35–45 min)

After test:

1. Mark:
   - Correct, wrong, unattempted.  
2. Compute:
   - Attempted questions.  
   - Correct answers.  
   - Accuracy = correct / attempted.

3. Break errors down:

   - **Concept/Interpretation errors:**
     - Misunderstood what the question asked (e.g., “% of total of *those two years* not *all years*”).  
   - **Reading/Unit errors:**
     - Misread axis scale, ignored “in thousands”, etc.  
   - **Arithmetic errors:**
     - Wrong addition, division, or % calculation.  
   - **Time/Strategy errors:**
     - Spent too much time on one tough question.

4. Re-solve every incorrect or skipped question:
   - Redo calmly with full steps.  
   - If concept-based, note down the “lesson” (e.g., “Whenever I see ‘percentage increase’, write formula explicitly”).

5. Create a **“DI mistake log”** page:
   - For each key mistake, note:
     - DI type (table/bar/line/pie).  
     - Small example of mistake.  
     - Quick rule to avoid it next time.

### 4. Weekly Reflection (10–15 min)

Write down:

1. Confidence rating (1–10) in:
   - Table DI  
   - Bar/Line DI  
   - Pie-chart DI  
   - General arithmetic for DI

2. Observations:
   - Which DI type feels natural now?  
   - Which still feels heavy or slow?

3. Plan for maintenance in later weeks:
   - e.g., “Twice a week: 2 DI sets under 20-minute timer.”  
   - “Daily: 5 mental %/ratio/average calculations.”

4. Any habits you want to formalize:
   - Circling units.  
   - Precomputing row/column totals.  
   - Underlining “of total”, “of those years only”, etc.

---

You now have 5 weeks of structured preparation behind you. Next, you’ll start balancing more **Logical Reasoning and Verbal** with ongoing Quant+DI revision. If you’d like, I can build a **Week 6 Day 1–7 plan** focused on core Logical Reasoning (arrangements, puzzles) integrated with short daily Quant/DI refresh.
