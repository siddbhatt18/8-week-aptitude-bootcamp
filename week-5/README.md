Here’s your **Week 5 (Day 1–7) plan**, focused on:

- Data Interpretation (DI): tables, bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts  
- Basic Logical Reasoning (LR): arrangements, puzzles, ranking  
- Applying arithmetic (percent, ratio, average) inside DI/LR under time

Assume ~1–1.5 hours/day. If you have more time, increase practice questions or add another DI set each day.

Use aptitude sites and filter by:
- “Data Interpretation – Table / Bar Graph / Pie Chart / Line Graph”
- “Logical Reasoning – Seating Arrangement / Puzzles / Ranking”

## General Daily Structure

Each day (except the mock day) will roughly follow:

1. **Concept/Pattern Review (15–20 min)**  
2. **Focused Practice Set (DI or LR) (30–35 min)**  
3. **Short Mixed Drill (10–15 min)**  
4. **Review & Error Notes (10–15 min)**  

---

## Day 1 – Table-based DI (Basics)

### 1. Concepts (15–20 min)
- How to read tables quickly:
  - Identify rows and columns.
  - Note units (lakhs, thousands, %, etc.).
- Common operations:
  - Row/column totals.
  - Percent contribution: part/total × 100.
  - Ratios between cell values.
- Strategy:
  - Read the **question first** (what do they want?).  
  - Then scan relevant rows/columns; don’t stare at the entire table.

### 2. Focused Practice (30–35 min)
Target: **2 small table DI sets**, ~4–5 questions each (total 8–10 Q).

Typical set description:
- A table showing sales/production/enrolment of 4–5 items (A, B, C, D) over 4–5 years.

Question types to practice:
1. Totals:
   - “What is total sales of product A over all years?”
2. Max/min:
   - “In which year were total sales maximum?”
3. Percent & ratio:
   - “What % of total sales in 2020 was from product C?”  
   - “Find ratio of sales of A in 2019 to B in 2021.”
4. Average:
   - “What is the average number of units sold of product D over 4 years?”

**Reinforces**
- Adding quickly and accurately.
- Using % and ratios inside DI.

### 3. Mixed Drill (10–15 min)
- 4–5 quick calculations drawn from Week 1–4 skills:
  - 2–3 percent/ratio questions.
  - 2 average questions.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- For each DI question you missed or were slow on:
  - Note if the issue was:
    - Misreading the table,
    - Slow addition/percentage,
    - Not noticing the units.
- Write 2–3 small tips for yourself (e.g., “Underline year and product names in the question”).

## Day 2 – Bar Graph DI + Speed with Totals & % Change

### 1. Concepts (15–20 min)
- Reading bar graphs:
  - Vertical vs. horizontal bars.
  - Scale on the axis (each unit may be 10, 50, 100, etc.).
- Common calculations:
  - % increase/decrease between years.
  - Difference between bars for comparisons.
  - Ratios of bar heights.

### 2. Focused Practice (30–35 min)
Target: **2 bar-graph sets**, ~4–5 questions each (8–10 Q total).

Set descriptions:
- Bar graph showing:
  - Students in different departments across years,
  - Profits of a company across quarters, etc.

Question types:
1. Absolute difference:
   - “What is the difference between sales of 2019 and 2020?”
2. % change:
   - “By what % did sales increase from 2018 to 2019?”
3. Combined quantity:
   - “What is total number of students from CSE and ECE in 2020?”
4. Ratio:
   - “Find ratio of students in 2019 to those in 2021.”

**Reinforces**
- Interpreting scales correctly.
- Quick percent change and differences.

### 3. Mixed Drill (10–15 min)
- 4–6 questions:
  - 2–3 table DI questions from Day 1 (re-solved quickly).
  - 2–3 bar questions you already did, but this time untimed and for accuracy.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Note if you struggled more with:
  - Reading exact bar values,
  - Percent change formula: (new–old)/old × 100.
- Write 1–2 lines summarizing your personal common mistake.

## Day 3 – Pie Chart DI + Approximation

### 1. Concepts (15–20 min)
- Pie chart basics:
  - Whole circle = 360°.  
  - Each category represented by either:
    - Angle (degrees), or
    - Percentage of the total.
- Key skills:
  - Converting angle to value: (angle/360) × total.
  - Converting % to value: (%/100) × total.
  - Sometimes, approximate to avoid heavy calculation.

### 2. Focused Practice (30–35 min)
Target: **2 pie-chart sets**, ~4–5 Q each (8–10 Q total).

Set descriptions:
- Pie chart showing:
  - Expenditure distribution of a company.
  - Market share of 5 companies.
  - Time spent on different activities, etc.

Question types:
1. Direct slice value:
   - “If total expenditure is 20 lakhs and ‘Salaries’ is 25%, find expenditure on salaries.”
2. Comparison:
   - “Which category has maximum expenditure?”
3. Ratio & % share:
   - “What is ratio of expenditure on Rent to Marketing?”
4. Combined categories:
   - “What % of total is spent on Salaries and R&D together?”

**Reinforces**
- Working comfortably with percentages of a total.
- Quick approximations (e.g., 18% of 500 ≈ 90).

### 3. Mixed Drill (10–15 min)
- 4–6 questions:
  - 2 table + 2 bar + 1–2 pie (mix from previous practice).

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Write down:
  - Formula: Value = (% of total) × total OR (angle/360)×total.
- If approximations were needed, review if they were safe (did they change final multiple-choice answer?).

## Day 4 – Line Graph DI + First Basic LR (Distribution)

### 1. Concepts (15–20 min)
Part A – Line Graphs:
- Line joining points (year vs value, time vs data, etc.).
- Identify increase/decrease trends.

Part B – Simple LR Distribution:
- A set of people assigned different things (fruits, colors, jobs).
- Use table structure to track possibilities.
- Basic technique:
  - Draw table (persons vs items).
  - Mark ✓ / ✗ as per clues, eliminate options step-by-step.

### 2. Focused Practice (30–35 min)
Target:
- **1 line graph DI set** (4–5 Q).  
- **1 simple LR distribution puzzle** (4–6 Q).

Line graph question types:
- “In which year is the value highest/lowest?”
- “What is average of values over all given years?”
- “Between which years is the maximum increase?”

LR distribution example types:
- 4–5 people (A, B, C, D, E) each choose a different fruit.
- Given 5–6 clues, determine who gets which fruit.

**Reinforces**
- Trend reading in line DI.
- Structured logical deduction via a table.

### 3. Mixed Drill (10–15 min)
- 2–3 DI questions (any type) +  
- 2–3 very easy LR distribution or “who-likes-what” from online practice.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- For LR, keep your solved table as a model of “good diagram”.
- Note which step of puzzle felt confusing, and how you eventually resolved it.

---

## Day 5 – Linear Seating Arrangements (Basic) + Small DI Set

### 1. Concepts (15–20 min)
- Linear seating (all facing same direction, usually North):
  - Represent seats as blocks: _ _ _ _ _ .
  - Use relative positions like:
    - “A is second to the left of B.”
    - “C sits at one end.”
- Strategy:
  - Fix one person as a reference (e.g., put B somewhere in the middle).
  - Place others relatively; if contradiction appears, adjust.

### 2. Focused Practice (30–35 min)
Target:
- **2 simple linear seating puzzles** (3–5 Q each, total 6–10 Q).
- Difficulty: 6–8 people in a row, simple clues.

Question types within each puzzle:
- “Who sits at the extreme ends?”
- “Who is between X and Y?”
- “How many persons sit between A and D?”

**Reinforces**
- Drawing neat layouts quickly.
- Translating statements like “A is three seats away from B” into positions.

### 3. Short DI Set (10–15 min)
- 1 small DI set (table or bar graph) with **4–5 Q**.
- Solve faster but maintain accuracy.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Keep your seating diagrams; mark any false start you had.
- Note your typical confusion:
  - Left vs right when facing North/South.
- Practice one puzzle again from scratch to see if you can do it faster.

## Day 6 – Mixed DI + Mixed LR (Speed Practice)

### 1. Concepts (10–15 min)
- Quick recap:
  - For all DI: read question → go to data → compute only what is needed.
  - For LR: diagram is more important than mental solving.
- Decide a **rough time target**:
  - ~1.5–2 minutes per DI question.
  - ~5–8 minutes per LR puzzle (all questions).

### 2. Mixed Practice (35–40 min)
Target: **2 DI sets + 1 LR puzzle**:
- DI:
  - 1 table + 1 pie/bar/line (4–5 Q each → ~8–10 Q).
- LR:
  - 1 puzzle (either distribution or linear seating) with 4–6 Q.

Try to complete all in **35–40 minutes**.

**Reinforces**
- Switching between numeric (DI) and logic-structure (LR) thinking.
- Managing time: not getting stuck too long on one question.

### 3. Error-Focused Drill (10–15 min)
- From the above mixed set, pick:
  - 3 DI questions you were slow/wrong on.
  - 1 LR puzzle if it gave trouble.
- Re-solve them slowly, making sure:
  - You use a better table/layout.
  - You choose shorter arithmetic wherever possible.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Write a mini-strategy:
  - “For DI: I will circle required columns/rows.”  
  - “For LR: I will always draw a base diagram first; no mental juggling.”

---

## Day 7 – Week 5 Mini Mock (DI + LR) + Review

### 1. Timed Mini Mock (40–45 min)
Create a small mock of **20–25 questions**, roughly:

- DI: 12–15 questions
  - 3–4 from tables,
  - 3–4 from bar/line,
  - 3–4 from pie chart or mixed graph.
- LR: 8–10 questions
  - 1–2 seating/distribution puzzles.

Recommended structure:
- 3–4 sets total (e.g., 3 DI sets + 1–2 LR puzzles).
- Sit for 40–45 minutes **without pausing**.
- Strategy:
  - First pass: Quickly identify the easiest set (maybe table or bar) and finish those.
  - Then move to moderate ones.
  - If a question within a set feels too long, skip and come back only if time allows.

### 2. Mock Review (30–40 min)
For each question, especially wrong/guessed:

- Identify reason:
  1. Misread data (e.g., wrong year/category).
  2. Calculation error (arithmetic).
  3. Logical setup error (for LR).
  4. Time pressure: left unattempted.

- For each type:
  - (1): Practice carefully reading and underlining keywords.  
  - (2): Re-do calculation more cleanly; check if there was a simpler way.  
  - (3): Redraw puzzle diagrams and solve step-by-step.  
  - (4): See if you spent too long on one set and how you might skip earlier.

### 3. Week 5 Summary Sheet (15–20 min)
On a single page, jot down:

- DI:
  - Key steps for table, bar, pie, line.
  - Two small tricks that helped your speed (e.g., mental sum tricks, approximate %).
- LR:
  - Standard template for linear seating.
  - Template for a distribution puzzle table.

Keep this sheet for quick revision before full aptitude mocks.

## By End of Week 5 You Should:

- Comfortably interpret tables, bar graphs, line graphs, and pie charts.
- Solve typical DI questions (totals, % changes, averages, ratios) within ~1.5–2 minutes each.
- Handle basic LR puzzles (simple seating/distribution) with a clear, systematic method.
- Be ready to include DI + LR sections in your **full-length mock tests** from Week 7–8.

If you want next, I can design **Week 6 (Day 1–7)** focusing on core Probability and Permutation–Combination patterns.
