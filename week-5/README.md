Here’s a structured **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 5**, focused on:

- Data Interpretation (DI): tables, bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts  
- Applied Percentages & Ratios (inside DI)  
- Speed + accuracy under light time pressure  

Target: **~1.5–2.5 hours per day**. Adjust as needed.

You’ll need:  
- Any aptitude book/website with DI sets (e.g., RS Aggarwal, Arun Sharma basic level, IndiaBix, PrepInsta, GeeksforGeeks, TCS NQT/Infosys/Cognizant PYQs).  
- A notebook for formulas, shortcuts, and mistakes.

---

## Core Ideas for Week 5

- DI is just: **reading data carefully + doing fast arithmetic**.  
- 80–20 focus:
  - Learn to quickly compute: ratios, percent change, averages, totals.  
  - Practice *sets* (3–5 questions per graph/table), not isolated questions.
- Always:
  1. Scan the diagram first (what does each axis/column represent?).  
  2. Mark key totals/years/categories.  
  3. For each question, identify whether it wants:
     - Sum / average  
     - Ratio / percentage  
     - Max/min / comparison.

## Day 1 – Table DI + Quick Percent & Ratio Refresh

### 1. Warm-up Revision (Percent & Ratio) – 20–25 min

Before DI, refresh the tools you’ll use constantly:

a) **Percent basics**
- % change = ((new – old)/old) × 100.  
- Fast mental %: 10%, 20%, 25%, 50%, 33⅓%, etc.

b) **Ratios in context**
- Ratio of values (e.g., sales A : sales B).  
- Converting ratio to fraction of total (e.g., 2:3 → 2/5 and 3/5).

Do 6–8 quick questions:
- 3–4 on % increase/decrease.  
- 3–4 on ratios and parts.

### 2. Concept Learning: Table DI – 25–30 min

a) **How to read tables**
- Rows vs columns (e.g., years vs products, subjects vs students).  
- Watch units: millions, thousands, %, etc.

b) **Typical question types**
- Total / sum over rows or columns.  
- % change from one year to next.  
- Average of selected entries.  
- Ratios between categories.

### 3. Guided Practice – Table DI (45–60 min)

Pick **2 small table sets** (4–5 questions each).

**Set 1 – Beginner**

Example table: Company sales (A, B, C) over years (2018–2022).

Types of questions:
1. Total sales of Company A over all years.  
2. In which year is total sales (A+B+C) maximum?  
3. Average sales of Company B.  
4. Ratio of Company A’s sales in 2020 to Company C’s sales in 2020.  
5. % increase in total sales from 2019 to 2020.

**Set 2 – Intermediate**

Example table: Students’ marks in different subjects.

Types of questions:
1. Total marks of a student across all subjects.  
2. Who scored highest/lowest in a subject?  
3. % of total marks obtained by a given student.  
4. Compare performance across two students using averages.

**Key Concepts Reinforced**
- Summing columns/rows quickly.  
- Calculating % and ratios inside DI.  
- Reading and interpreting table titles & units.

### 4. Speed Drill – 10–15 min

- Choose 1 small table DI set (4–5 Q).

- Mark them for extra practice this week.

---

## Day 2 – Bar Graphs + Applied Percentages

### 1. Warm-up (Percent Change) – 15–20 min

Do 6–8 stand-alone problems on:
- % increase/decrease between two values.  
- Comparing % increase across categories.

Example:
- “Quantity goes from 80 to 100 → % increase?”  
- “Sales: 2019=200, 2020=260, 2021=286 → which year had higher % growth?”

### 2. Concept Learning: Bar Graphs – 25–30 min

a) **Types**
- Single bar (one quantity over years).  
- Double/multiple bar (comparing categories each year).

b) **What to look for**
- Axis labels (time? cities? products?).  
- Scale (does each bar division = 10, 50, 100?).  
- Legend (which color represents which category).

c) **Common questions**
- Compare heights: greater/less.  
- Find totals (sum of multiple bars).  
- Compute % share or % change from one bar to another.  
- Highest/lowest bar or difference of bars.

### 3. Guided Practice – Bar Graph DI (45–60 min)

Pick **2 bar graph sets** (4–5 Q each).

**Set 1 – Beginner**

Example: Number of students in 5 different classes (A–E).

Questions:
1. Which class has maximum students?  
2. Total students in all classes.  
3. What % of total students are in class C?  
4. Ratio of students in A and D.  
5. Difference between highest and lowest.

**Set 2 – Intermediate**

Example: Company’s quarterly profits for 5 years, with 2 bars per year (Product X and Y).

Questions:
1. In which year does Product X have max sales?  
2. Total sales of Product Y over all years.  
3. In which year is the difference between X and Y highest?  
4. For a given year, X as a % of total (X+Y).  
5. % change in sales of X from 2019 to 2021.

**Reinforces**
- Reading bar heights accurately.  
- Doing quick % and ratio comparisons.  
- Handling two-variable data per year.

### 4. Speed Drill – 10–15 min

- 1 bar-graph set (4–5 Q) in **10–12 minutes**.

Do 6–8 small questions:
- Ratios of two quantities.  
- Simple averages of 3–5 numbers.  
- Combining two averages when totals/weights differ.

### 2. Concept Learning: Line Graphs – 25–30 min

a) **How to read line graphs**
- X-axis: usually time.  
- Y-axis: value (price, production, etc.).  
- Multiple lines: each represents a different entity.

b) **Typical questions**
- Trend (increasing, decreasing, fluctuating).  
- Magnitude of change between consecutive points.  
- Average over time.  
- Compare slopes → relative growth.

### 3. Guided Practice – Line Graph DI (45–60 min)

Pick **2 line-graph sets**.

**Set 1 – Beginner**

Example: Monthly expenses of a person for 6 months.

Questions:
1. In which month is expense highest/lowest?  
2. Total expenses over the 6 months.  
3. Average monthly expense.  
4. % increase from January to June.  
5. Between which two months is the maximum increase?

**Set 2 – Intermediate**

## Day 4 – Pie Charts + Part–Whole & Percent Share

### 1. Warm-up (Fractions ↔ Percent) – 15–20 min

Quickly revise:
- Common fractions as % (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, …).  
- Give 10 random fractions like 2/5, 3/8, 5/6 and roughly estimate %.

This helps in reading pie charts with angles or percentages.

### 2. Concept Learning: Pie Charts – 25–30 min

a) **Basics**
- Entire circle = 360° or 100%.  
- Each sector: either given as angle or % or value.  
- If total = T and a section is k% of total, its value is = (k/100)×T.

b) **Typical questions**
- Find actual value from % share.  
- Compare shares (which category largest/smallest).  
- Combine categories (“A+B share”).  
- Increased/decreased totals across two pie charts (two years).

### 3. Guided Practice – Pie Chart DI (45–60 min)

Pick **2 sets**.

**Set 1 – Beginner**

Example: Pie chart of monthly budget: Rent, Food, Transport, Savings, Others.

Questions:
1. If total monthly income is ₹40,000, find expense on each category.  
2. What % is spent on Rent and Food together?  
3. Which category has minimum share?  
4. If savings increase by 5% next month (absolute amount), new savings?

**Set 2 – Intermediate**

Example: Two pie charts: Market share of companies in Year 1 and Year 2.

Questions:
1. For Company A, how much did its absolute market size (in units or ₹) change, given total market sizes?  
2. Which company gained most market share in terms of % points?  
3. If total market in Year 1 is 1000 units, Year 2 is 1200, compute sales of a company in both years.  
4. Which company’s revenue grew the most in absolute terms?

**Reinforces**
- Using % of total quickly.  
- Comparing slices logically.  
- Combining information from two pie charts (change over years).

### 4. Speed Drill – 10–15 min

- 1 pie-chart set (4–5 Q) in **10–12 minutes**.  
- Focus on:
  - Translating % into actual numbers quickly.  
  - Not over-precising when options are not close (MCQ).

### 5. Quick Recap – 5–10 min

- Note formulas:
  - Value of sector = (sector% × total)/100  
  - If given angle instead: sector% = angle/360 × 100

## Day 5 – Mixed DI Sets (Tables + Graphs) & Strategy

### 1. Quick Revision (Key Operations) – 20–25 min

- 2–3 questions each on:
  - % change  
  - Ratios  
  - Averages  

Focus on getting them fast and clean.

### 2. Concept: Solving DI Sets Strategically – 20–25 min

a) **Order of solving**
- Skim the whole set first.  
- For time-limited tests:  
  - Solve direct questions first (totals, single-year, etc.).  
  - Leave multi-step or “highest % change among all” for later.

b) **Approximation vs exact**
- When answer choices are far apart, rough calculation is fine.  
- When close, do precise arithmetic.

c) **Skipping wisely**
- If one question seems very calculation-heavy, skip and return if time.

### 3. Mixed DI Practice (2–3 Sets) – 60–75 min

- Choose **2–3 sets** including mix of:
  - Table + bar graph  
  - Two tables  
  - Table + pie chart  
  - Or just any standard mixed DI from PYQ.

Structure example:

**Set 1 (Table + Bar Graph)**  
- Students’ performance in various subjects + a bar graph of pass/fail counts.

**Set 2 (Line Graph + Pie Chart)**  
- Company’s monthly production (line) + yearly revenue distribution (pie).

Try to solve **10–15 questions total** from these sets in **60–75 minutes** in one sitting.

**Reinforces**
- Switching across DI formats  
- Applying the same core operations (sum, %, ratio) regardless of visual form  
- Time management per set

### 4. Short Review – 10–15 min

- Mark:
  - Which set felt easiest/hardest?  
  - Which operation repeatedly slowed you (e.g., big-number multiplication, % change, ratio simplification)?

---

## Day 6 – Timed DI Practice (Mock-style)

### 1. Light Revision – 15–20 min

- Skim your notes: tables, bar, line, pie.  
- Revisit 1–2 tricky questions from earlier days and re-solve quickly.

### 2. Timed DI Section – 45–60 min

Simulate a real DI section:

- Choose **3–4 DI sets**, mixed types.  
- Total questions: around **15–20**.  
- Give yourself **45–50 minutes**.

Try to:
- Spend 2–3 minutes to scan all sets.  
- Start with the one that looks easiest.  
- Aim at ~2–3 minutes per question on average (some shorter, some longer).

### 3. Detailed Review – 25–35 min

For each question:

- If correct and fast → good; no need to dwell too long.  
- If correct but slow → analyze:  
  - Could a trick / approximation reduce steps?  
  - Could pre-checking options help?

- If wrong:
  - Was it misreading the graph/table?  
  - Wrong arithmetic?  
  - Misinterpreted what’s being asked (e.g., % of A over B vs B over A)?

Write brief corrections and patterns in your notebook.

## Day 7 – Weekly Revision + Mini-Mock (DI-Focused)

### 1. Concept Recap – 30–40 min

Go over:

- How to read:
  - Tables  
  - Bar graphs  
  - Line graphs  
  - Pie charts  

- The **standard question types**:
  - Sum/total  
  - Average  
  - Ratio  
  - % share  
  - % change  
  - Max/min, difference

For each format, solve 2–3 “representative” problems from your earlier work without looking at the solution.

### 2. DI Mini-Mock – 45–60 min

Create or pick a **full DI mini-section**:

- 4–5 sets  
- Total **20–25 questions**  
- Mix:
  - Table  
  - Bar  
  - Line  
  - Pie  
  - At least one set with mixed data (e.g., table + graph)

Time: **45–50 minutes**, test conditions.

### 3. Error Analysis & Wrap-Up – 25–35 min

- Compute your score and approximate accuracy.  
- Identify:
  - Formats you are strongest/weakest in.  
  - Operation types that are causing mistakes (especially % and ratios).  

For each weak area, write a 2–3 line plan:
- “Next week, I will practice 10 mins daily of % change”  
- “Twice a week: 1 extra pie chart set,” etc.

---

## How Week 5 Fits into the Bigger Plan

From next week (Week 6), you’ll focus on **algebra & word problems** while continuing:

- Short, daily **mental math** (fractions, %).  
- 1–2 DI sets per week to keep the skill alive.

If you tell me whether you’re preparing for a specific company (e.g., TCS NQT, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, product-based), I can suggest how many DI questions per day you should target and what difficulty (easy/medium/hard) mix to aim for.
