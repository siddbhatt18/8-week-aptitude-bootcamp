## Block 0 – Quick Recap of Day 1 (10–15 minutes)

Before new content, strengthen yesterday’s base.

1. Open your notebook:
   - Look at **Concepts** from Day 1: types of numbers and divisibility rules (2, 3, 5, 9, 10).
   - Spend 3–4 minutes reading them.

2. On rough paper, without looking:
   - Write divisibility rules for 2, 3, 5, 9, 10.  
   - Give one example for each rule.

3. Self-check:
   - Compare with your notes and correct any mistake.
   - If you still confuse 3 vs 9, mark this in **Mistakes & Doubts**.

4. Very short mental drill (2–3 min):
   - Take 5 random 3-digit numbers and quickly decide: divisible by 2? by 3? by 5? by 9? by 10?  
   - Don’t write full working; do it mostly in your head.

Then move on.

## Block 1 – New Concepts: Divisibility Rules (4, 6, 8, 11) (25–30 minutes)

Create a new heading in **Concepts**: “Divisibility – Part 2”.

### 1.1 Learn / Revise Rules (15–20 min)

Write each rule with a simple example and, if possible, a counterexample.

1. **Divisibility by 4**
   - Rule: A number is divisible by 4 if its **last two digits** form a number divisible by 4.
   - Examples:
     - 312 → last two digits = 12 → 12 ÷ 4 = 3 → divisible by 4.  
     - 728 → last two digits = 28 → 28 ÷ 4 = 7 → divisible by 4.  
   - Counterexample:
     - 314 → last two digits = 14 → not divisible by 4.

2. **Divisibility by 6**
   - Rule: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by **both 2 and 3**.
   - So:
     - Last digit must be even (divisible by 2).  
     - Sum of digits must be divisible by 3.
   - Example:
     - 252 → last digit 2 (even) and 2+5+2=9 (divisible by 3) → divisible by 6.

3. **Divisibility by 8**
   - Rule: A number is divisible by 8 if its **last three digits** form a number divisible by 8.
   - Example:
     - 5, 1**36** → 136 ÷ 8 = 17 → number divisible by 8.  
     - 1**000** → 000 = 0, which is divisible by 8 → 1000 is divisible by 8.
   - Counterexample:
     - 5, 1**40** → 140 ÷ 8 = 17.5 → not divisible by 8.

4. **Divisibility by 11**
   - Rule:  
     - Take **sum of digits at odd positions** and **sum of digits at even positions** (from right or left, but be consistent).  
     - Find the difference of these sums.  
     - If the difference is 0 or divisible by 11, the number is divisible by 11.
   - Example (from rightmost as position 1):
     - 913:  
       - Positions from right: 3(1), 1(2), 9(3)  
       - Odd positions: 3 + 9 = 12  
       - Even positions: 1  
       - Difference: 12 − 1 = 11 → divisible by 11 → 913 divisible by 11.
   - Another example:  
     - 121:  
       - Positions from right: 1(1), 2(2), 1(3)  
       - Odd: 1 + 1 = 2  
       - Even: 2  
       - Difference: 2 − 2 = 0 → divisible by 11.

Write 1–2 examples under each rule.

### 1.2 Immediate Practice – Apply Rules (10 minutes)

On rough paper:

Test the following numbers using only rules, no long division:

1. Check divisibility by 4 and 8:
   - 624  
   - 512  
   - 913  
   - 1040  

2. Check divisibility by 6:
   - 132  
   - 245  
   - 270  
   - 318  

3. Check divisibility by 11:
   - 913  
   - 1001  
   - 242  
   - 352  

Write answers like:

- 624 → /4: ?, /8: ?  
- 132 → /6: ?  
- 913 → /11: ?

After solving, verify quickly (you can do one or two by actual division to build confidence).

Any rule that feels confusing (especially 11) – mark under **Mistakes & Doubts**.

## Block 2 – New Concepts: Prime Factorization, LCM & HCF (30–35 minutes)

Create new headings in **Concepts**:  
- “Prime Factorization”  
- “LCM & HCF – Basics”

### 2.1 Prime Factorization (10–15 min)

**Idea:** Write a number as a product of prime numbers.

Method (Division Method):

- Start dividing the number by the smallest possible prime.  
- Continue dividing until you reach 1.

Examples (write these neatly in your notebook):

1. 18:
   - 18 ÷ 2 = 9  
   - 9 ÷ 3 = 3  
   - 3 ÷ 3 = 1  
   - So, 18 = 2 × 3 × 3 = 2 × 3²

2. 60:
   - 60 ÷ 2 = 30  
   - 30 ÷ 2 = 15  
   - 15 ÷ 3 = 5  
   - 5 ÷ 5 = 1  
   - So, 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 2² × 3 × 5

3. 72:
   - 72 ÷ 2 = 36  
   - 36 ÷ 2 = 18  
   - 18 ÷ 2 = 9  
   - 9 ÷ 3 = 3  
   - 3 ÷ 3 = 1  
   - So, 72 = 2³ × 3²

Practice factorizing 3–4 more numbers (e.g., 24, 36, 45, 90) yourself.

### 2.2 LCM & HCF via Prime Factorization (20 minutes)

**Definitions:**

- **LCM (Least Common Multiple):**  
  Smallest positive number that is a multiple of all given numbers.

- **HCF / GCD (Highest Common Factor / Greatest Common Divisor):**  
  Largest number that divides all given numbers.

**Method using prime factors:**

For two numbers A and B:

1. Write A and B in prime factor form:
   - A = p₁ᵃ¹ × p₂ᵃ² × …  
   - B = p₁ᵇ¹ × p₂ᵇ² × …

2. **LCM**:
   - Take each prime that appears in either number.
   - Use the **highest power** of each prime.

3. **HCF**:
   - Take only primes that appear in both numbers.
   - Use the **lowest power** of each common prime.

Examples (write step-by-step):

1. LCM and HCF of 12 and 18:

   - 12 = 2² × 3¹  
   - 18 = 2¹ × 3²  

   - HCF:
     - Common primes: 2, 3  
     - Minimum powers: 2¹, 3¹  
     - HCF = 2¹ × 3¹ = 6

   - LCM:
     - All primes: 2, 3  
     - Maximum powers: 2², 3²  
     - LCM = 2² × 3² = 36

2. LCM and HCF of 24 and 36:

   - 24 = 2³ × 3¹  
   - 36 = 2² × 3²  

   - HCF:
     - Common primes: 2, 3  
     - Minimum powers: 2², 3¹  
     - HCF = 2² × 3¹ = 4 × 3 = 12

   - LCM:
     - Max powers: 2³, 3²  
     - LCM = 2³ × 3² = 8 × 9 = 72

3. Try one example with three numbers: 12, 18, 30

   - 12 = 2² × 3  
   - 18 = 2 × 3²  
   - 30 = 2 × 3 × 5  

   - HCF:
     - Common primes to all: 2, 3  
     - Min powers: 2¹, 3¹  
     - HCF = 2 × 3 = 6

   - LCM:
     - All primes: 2, 3, 5  
     - Max powers: 2², 3², 5¹  
     - LCM = 2² × 3² × 5 = 4 × 9 × 5 = 180

Copy these properly; you will reuse this method a lot.

## Block 3 – Guided Practice: Divisibility + LCM/HCF (40–45 minutes)

Use your book/website or these questions. Try to solve fully before checking solutions.

### 3.1 Divisibility – Structured Practice (15–20 min)

1. For each number, check divisibility by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 using rules:

   a) 624  
   b) 913  
   c) 540  
   d) 1001  
   e) 840  

   Make a small table in your notebook like:

   | Number | /2 | /3 | /4 | /5 | /6 | /8 | /9 | /10 | /11 |
   |--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|
   | 624    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |

   Fill Y/N based on rules.

2. Conceptual mini-questions:

   a) A number is divisible by 8 and 3. Is it necessarily divisible by 24?  
      - Think: 24 = 8 × 3, but check carefully.

   b) If a number is divisible by 11, what can you say about the difference between (sum of digits at odd positions) and (sum at even positions)?

3. Slightly tricky (practice for 11):

   Check divisibility by 11:

   - 1331  
   - 462  
   - 2728  

   Show sums of odd/even positions.

Record any repeated confusion with 11-rule under **Mistakes & Doubts**.

### 3.2 Prime Factorization + LCM/HCF – Practice (25 minutes)

**A. Prime Factorization (10 minutes)**

Factorize completely:

1. 18  
2. 45  
3. 90  
4. 56  
5. 100  

Write in form: p₁ᵃ × p₂ᵇ × …

Check with answers/key or calculator after attempting.

**B. LCM & HCF (15 minutes)**

1. Find LCM and HCF of (show all steps):

   a) 12 and 18  
   b) 24 and 36  
   c) 15 and 20  

2. Slightly more involved:

   d) 16 and 40  
   e) 8, 12, 20  
   f) 9, 15, 21  

   For each, write:

   - Prime factorization  
   - HCF using minimum powers  
   - LCM using maximum powers

If you know another method (like short division or Euclid’s algorithm), you can compare, but for now focus on prime-factorization method; it is very visual and safe.

## Block 4 – Applied / Word-Style Questions (Optional but Recommended) (15–20 minutes)

These are a bridge to the type of questions asked in actual aptitude tests.

1. “Find the smallest number which is divisible by 6, 8 and 10.”

   - Idea: Smallest number divisible by a set of numbers is their LCM.  
   - So compute LCM(6, 8, 10).

2. “Find the greatest number that exactly divides 36, 60 and 84.”

   - Idea: Greatest such number is their HCF.

3. “Find the smallest number which when divided by 4, 5 and 6 leaves a remainder of 3 in each case.”

   - Idea:
     - Number is 3 more than a common multiple of 4, 5, 6.  
     - Let L = LCM(4, 5, 6).  
     - Required number = L × k + 3.  
     - The smallest will be when k = 1.

4. “Find the least number which is exactly divisible by 12, 15, 20.”

   - Direct LCM problem.

Try these without looking at hints first; use hints only if stuck.

---

## Block 5 – Speed Drill: LCM/HCF + Divisibility (10–15 minutes)

**Aim:** Start doing LCM/HCF quickly, without hesitation.

1. Set a **timer for 12–15 minutes**.

2. Solve:

   - **5 LCM problems:**
     1. LCM of 6, 8  
     2. LCM of 9, 12  
     3. LCM of 10, 25  
     4. LCM of 4, 6, 9  
     5. LCM of 3, 5, 7  

   - **5 HCF problems:**
     6. HCF of 8, 12  
     7. HCF of 18, 30  
     8. HCF of 42, 56  
     9. HCF of 24, 60  
     10. HCF of 14, 21, 35  

3. Focus:
   - Don’t get stuck on any one problem for too long; write factorization quickly using primes up to 11.  
   - Aim to finish all 10 within the time. If not, note how many you completed.

4. After time’s up:
   - Check answers (from book/online/calculator).  
   - Mark which ones were wrong and why:
     - Incorrect factorization?  
     - Mixed up minimum/maximum power?  
     - Arithmetic slip?

Write key observations under **Mistakes & Doubts**.

## Block 6 – Reflection & Summary (10–15 minutes)

### 6.1 Day 2 Summary Notes (5–10 min)

In your notebook, under **Summary Day 2**, write in your own words:

1. Divisibility rules you learned today:
   - For 4: …  
   - For 6: …  
   - For 8: …  
   - For 11: …

2. Steps to find:
   - Prime factorization of a number.  
   - LCM using prime factors.  
   - HCF using prime factors.

3. One example each:
   - A number divisible by 4 but not by 8.  
   - A number divisible by 6 but not by 9.  
   - A pair of numbers whose LCM is 60 and HCF is 12 (you can construct or look up).

### 6.2 Mark Weak Points for Day 3 Revision (5 min)

Look at your **Mistakes & Doubts** from today and highlight:

- Any persistent confusion with:
  - Divisibility by 11 (odd/even position sums).  
  - Difference between LCM and HCF.  
  - Minimum vs maximum prime power.

These will be your **first 10–15 minutes of revision on Day 3** before you move on to Percentages.

## Optional Extra Practice (If You Have More Time)

If you still have 20–30 minutes and energy:

- Go to:
  - IndiaBix → Quantitative Aptitude → Number System →  
    - Subtopics: “Divisibility”, “HCF and LCM”.
- Solve:
  - 5–10 more divisibility questions involving 4, 6, 8, 11.  
  - 5–10 more HCF/LCM questions with 2–3 numbers.

Any interesting/tricky question → copy it (with full solution) into **Examples** so you can revisit later.

---

If you tell me which part of Day 2 (divisibility by 11 vs LCM/HCF vs prime factorization) took you the most time, I can simplify or intensify the start of Day 3’s plan for you.
