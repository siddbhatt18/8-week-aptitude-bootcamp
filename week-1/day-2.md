Day 2 builds directly on Day 1. Today you’ll move from *static* percentages (“x% of y”) to *changing* quantities (increase, decrease, successive change, and basic reverse %). These ideas appear all over profit–loss, salary, population, and DI questions.

Target time: ~2.5–3 hours.  
Flow: **Learn → Guided examples → Practice (increasing difficulty) → Speed drill → Reflection.**

## Core Objectives for Day 2

By the end of Day 2, you should be able to:

1. Compute **percentage increase/decrease** quickly:
   - `% change = (New – Old) / Old × 100`
2. Use **multipliers**:
   - Increase by a% → multiply by `(1 + a/100)`
   - Decrease by a% → multiply by `(1 – a/100)`
3. Handle **successive percentage changes** (e.g., +20% then −10%).
4. Do **basic reverse percentage**:
   - After a% increase, final value is F → Original = `F / (1 + a/100)`
   - After a% decrease, final value is F → Original = `F / (1 – a/100)`

---

## Block 1 (30–40 min): Concepts & Notes

Open your notebook. You’ll build a compact “cheat sheet” you can revise quickly.

### 1. Percentage change formula

Write and box this:

\[
\%\text{ change} = \frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}} \times 100
\]

- If New > Old → **Positive** = % increase.  
- If New < Old → **Negative** = % decrease (take absolute value, say “decreased by x%”).

**Mini‑examples (do in 1–2 lines each):**

1. From 100 to 120 → `(120 – 100)/100 × 100 = 20%` increase.  
2. From 200 to 150 → `(150 – 200)/200 × 100 = –25%` → 25% decrease.

### 2. Multiplier method (very important for speed)

Instead of using the percentage change formula every time, think like this:

- Increase by a%:
  - New = Old × `(1 + a/100)`
  - Example: +20% → multiply by `1.20`
- Decrease by a%:
  - New = Old × `(1 – a/100)`
  - Example: −30% → multiply by `0.70`

Write some common multipliers:

- +10% → × 1.10  
- +20% → × 1.20  
- +25% → × 1.25  
- +50% → × 1.50  
- −10% → × 0.90  
- −20% → × 0.80  
- −25% → × 0.75  
- −40% → × 0.60

You don’t need all memorized today; just understand the idea.

### 3. Successive percentage change

Two changes in sequence:

- First +a%, then +b%:
  - Overall multiplier = `(1 + a/100) × (1 + b/100)`
  - Overall % change = `(overall multiplier – 1) × 100%`
- Increase then decrease, or two decreases:
  - Just use the right multipliers and multiply.

**Example outline to write:**

- Price = P  
- Increase 20% → `1.2P`  
- Then decrease 10% → `1.2P × 0.9 = 1.08P`  
- Net change = +8%

### 4. Reverse percentage

Working backwards from final value:

- If a number is increased by a% and becomes F:
  - Original = `F / (1 + a/100)`
- If decreased by a% and becomes F:
  - Original = `F / (1 – a/100)`

## Block 2 (15–20 min): Guided Examples (Step-by-Step)

Do these *slowly* and neatly. They represent the main patterns.

### Example 1 – Simple % increase

The price of a shirt increases from ₹400 to ₹460. Find the % increase.

- Old = 400, New = 460  
- Change = 460 – 400 = 60  
- % increase = `(60 / 400) × 100 = 15%`  

**Answer:** 15% increase.

---

### Example 2 – Simple % decrease

The price of a phone drops from ₹12,000 to ₹10,200. Find the % decrease.

- Old = 12,000, New = 10,200  
- Change = 10,200 – 12,000 = –1,800  
- % decrease = `(1,800 / 12,000) × 100 = 15%`  

**Answer:** 15% decrease.

---

### Example 3 – Using multipliers (successive increase)

A salary is first increased by 10%, then by 20%. Overall % increase?

- After +10% → multiply by 1.10  
- After +20% → multiply by 1.20  
- Overall multiplier = 1.10 × 1.20 = 1.32  
- Overall % change = (1.32 – 1) × 100 = 32%  

**Answer:** 32% increase.

---

### Example 4 – Increase then decrease

A price is increased by 25% and then decreased by 20%. Net effect?

- Multiplier = 1.25 × 0.80 = 1.00  
- Overall % change = (1.00 – 1) × 100 = 0%  

**Answer:** No net change.

*(Good to remember: +25% then −20% brings you back to original.)*

---

### Example 5 – Reverse percentage (after increase)

After a 20% increase, a number becomes 360. Find the original number.

- Let original = x  
- After +20% → x × 1.20 = 360  
- So x = 360 / 1.20 = 300  

**Answer:** 300.

---

### Example 6 – Reverse percentage (after decrease)

A TV is sold for ₹15,300 after giving a 15% discount on the marked price. Find the marked price.

- Let MP = x  
- After 15% discount → selling price = x × 0.85  
- x × 0.85 = 15,300  
- x = 15,300 / 0.85 = 18,000  

**Answer:** ₹18,000.

## Answer Key (Check Only After You Attempt)

### Part A – Direct % Increase/Decrease

1. From 200 to 230 → change = 30 → (30/200)×100 = **15% increase**  
2. From 500 to 425 → change = 75 → (75/500)×100 = **15% decrease**  
3. From 72 to 90 → change = 18 → (18/72)×100 = 25% → **25% increase**  
4. From 80,000 to 68,000 → change = 12,000 → (12,000/80,000)×100 = **15% decrease**  
5. From 160 to 192 → change = 32 → (32/160)×100 = **20% increase**  
6. From 1,250 to 1,000 → change = 250 → (250/1,250)×100 = **20% decrease**

---

### Part B – Multipliers & Successive Changes

7. 25,000 increased by 12%:  
   - New = 25,000 × 1.12 = **28,000**

8. 1,200 decreased by 15%:  
   - New = 1,200 × 0.85 = **1,020**

9. Population 80,000, +5% then +10%:  
   - Multiplier = 1.05 × 1.10 = 1.155  
   - New = 80,000 × 1.155 = **92,400**

10. +10% then +10%:  
    - Multiplier = 1.1 × 1.1 = 1.21  
    - Overall = (1.21 – 1)×100 = **21% increase**

11. −20% then −10%:  
    - Multiplier = 0.8 × 0.9 = 0.72  
    - Overall = (0.72 – 1)×100 = −28% → **28% decrease**

12. −25% then +25%:  
    - Multiplier = 0.75 × 1.25 = 0.9375  
    - Overall = (0.9375 – 1)×100 = −6.25% → **6.25% decrease**  

---

### Part C – Reverse Percentage

13. After +15% → 230:  
    - x × 1.15 = 230 → x = 230 / 1.15 = **200**

14. After −20% → 400:  
    - x × 0.8 = 400 → x = 400 / 0.8 = **500**

15. 10% discount, SP = 900:  
    - MP × 0.9 = 900 → MP = 900 / 0.9 = **1,000**

16. +10% then −10%, final = 49,500:  
    - Combined multiplier = 1.1 × 0.9 = 0.99  
    - Original = 49,500 / 0.99 = **50,000**  
    - Net change = −1% (1% decrease)

17. After +25%, population = 1,25,000:  
    - x × 1.25 = 1,25,000 → x = 1,25,000 / 1.25 = **1,00,000**

---

### Part D – Word / Mixed Problems

18. Price +25% → multiplier 1.25. For same expenditure, quantity × price must be constant:
    - Old: P × Q  
    - New: 1.25P × Q_new = P × Q  
    - Q_new = Q / 1.25 = 0.8Q → 20% reduction.  
    **Answer:** Reduce consumption by **20%**.

19. Let B = 100 → A = 120 (20% more).  
    - B is how much less than A? Difference = 20.  
    - % less = (20 / 120) × 100 = **16⅔%** (≈16.67%)

20. Let income = I.  
    - Old: expenditure = 0.8I, savings = 0.2I.  
    - New income = 1.25I  
    - New expenditure = 1.2 × 0.8I = 0.96I  
    - New savings = 1.25I – 0.96I = 0.29I  
    - Increase in savings = 0.29I – 0.2I = 0.09I  
    - % increase = (0.09I / 0.2I) × 100 = 45%  
    **Answer:** Savings increase by **45%**.

21. +30% then −30%, final = 4,550:  
    - Multiplier = 1.3 × 0.7 = 0.91  
    - Original = 4,550 / 0.91 = **5,000**  
    - Net change = (0.91 − 1)×100 = −9% → **9% decrease**

22. +40% then −40%:  
    - Multiplier = 1.4 × 0.6 = 0.84  
    - Final is 84% of original → **16% decrease**

2. 840 decreased by 15% = 840 × 0.85 = 714  
3. 1,600 increased by 25% = 1,600 × 1.25 = 2,000  
4. 900 decreased by 10% = 900 × 0.9 = 810  
5. 2,000 increased by 7.5% → 2,000 × 1.075 = 2,150  
6. 1,200 decreased by 6.25% (1/16) → decrease = 1,200/16 = 75 → new = 1,125  
7. 720 × 1.08 × 1.05 = 720 × 1.134 = **816.48**  
8. 1,000 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 1,000 × 0.81 = **810**
