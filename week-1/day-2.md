## 📖 **PART 1: CONCEPT MASTERY (9:00 - 10:30 AM)**

### **Section A: Basic Divisibility Rules (2, 3, 4, 5, 6)**

#### **Rule 1: Divisibility by 2**
```
Rule: Last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
Speed Check: Look only at unit digit
```

**Examples:**
- 4,738 → Last digit 8 (even) → ✓ Divisible by 2
- 9,651 → Last digit 1 (odd) → ✗ Not divisible by 2

#### **Rule 2: Divisibility by 3**
```
Rule: Sum of all digits is divisible by 3
Speed Trick: Keep adding digits until single digit
```

**Example:** Is 8,745 divisible by 3?
```
8 + 7 + 4 + 5 = 24
2 + 4 = 6
6 ÷ 3 = 2 → ✓ Divisible by 3
```

#### **Rule 3: Divisibility by 4**
```
Rule: Last two digits form a number divisible by 4
Alternative: If tens digit is even, unit digit must be 0, 4, 8
           If tens digit is odd, unit digit must be 2, 6
```

**Examples:**
- 7,316 → Last two digits: 16 → 16 ÷ 4 = 4 → ✓ Divisible
- 5,234 → Last two digits: 34 → 34 ÷ 4 = 8.5 → ✗ Not divisible

**Quick Mental Check Pattern:**
```
00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48,
52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96
```

#### **Rule 4: Divisibility by 5**
```
Rule: Last digit is 0 or 5
Speed Check: Instant - just check unit digit
```

#### **Rule 5: Divisibility by 6**
```
Rule: Divisible by both 2 AND 3
Process: Check rule 2 first (faster), then rule 3
```

**Example:** Is 7,842 divisible by 6?
```
Step 1: Last digit 2 (even) → ✓ Divisible by 2
Step 2: 7+8+4+2 = 21 → 2+1 = 3 → ✓ Divisible by 3
Result: ✓ Divisible by 6
```

### **Practice Set A: Basic Rules (10 minutes)**

5. 8,956: ÷2✓, ÷3✗, ÷4✓, ÷5✗, ÷6✗
</details>

### **Section B: Advanced Divisibility Rules (7, 8, 9, 10)**

#### **Rule 6: Divisibility by 7**
```
Method 1: Double the last digit and subtract from rest
Method 2: Truncate last digit, subtract double of it
Repeat until you get a small number
```

**Example:** Is 3,591 divisible by 7?
```
Method 1:
359 - (1×2) = 359 - 2 = 357
35 - (7×2) = 35 - 14 = 21
21 ÷ 7 = 3 → ✓ Divisible by 7
```

**Alternative Quick Method for 7:**
```
Break into groups of 3 from right: 1,001 = 7 × 143
So for any 6-digit number abc,def:
Check if (abc - def) is divisible by 7
```

#### **Rule 7: Divisibility by 8**
```
Rule: Last three digits form a number divisible by 8
Quick Check: For 3-digit endings, if middle digit is even and...
```

**Pattern for last 3 digits divisible by 8:**
```
000, 008, 016, 024, 032, 040, 048, 056, 064, 072, 080, 088, 096,
104, 112, 120, 128, 136, 144, 152, 160, 168, 176, 184, 192,
200, 208, 216, ... (continue pattern)
```

#### **Rule 8: Divisibility by 9**
```
Rule: Sum of all digits is divisible by 9
Speed Trick: Cast out nines (ignore digits that sum to 9)
```

**Example with Speed Trick:** Is 87,534 divisible by 9?
```
Normal: 8+7+5+3+4 = 27 → 2+7 = 9 → ✓
Speed: 8+7=15→6, ignore 5+4=9, left with 6+3=9 → ✓
```

#### **Rule 9: Divisibility by 10**
```
Rule: Last digit is 0
Instant Check: Just look at unit digit
```

### **Practice Set B: Advanced Rules (10 minutes)**
Check divisibility by 7, 8, 9, 10:

1. 4,536
2. 3,864
3. 7,119

5. 6,713: ÷7✗, ÷8✗, ÷9✗, ÷10✗
</details>

### **Section C: Special Divisibility Rules (11, 12, 13)**

#### **Rule 10: Divisibility by 11**
```
Rule: (Sum of odd-positioned digits) - (Sum of even-positioned digits) = 0 or multiple of 11
Position counting: Start from right as position 1
```

**Example:** Is 9,53,847 divisible by 11?
```
Positions:  6  5  4  3  2  1
Number:     9  5  3  8  4  7

Odd positions (1,3,5): 7 + 8 + 5 = 20
Even positions (2,4,6): 4 + 3 + 9 = 16
Difference: 20 - 16 = 4 → ✗ Not divisible by 11
```

**Quick Pattern for 11:**
- Palindromes with even digits (1221, 135531) always divisible by 11
- Numbers like 121, 1331, 14641 are powers of 11

#### **Rule 11: Divisibility by 12**
```
Rule: Divisible by both 3 AND 4
Process: Check divisibility by 4 first (easier)
```

#### **Rule 12: Divisibility by 13**
```
Method: Add 4 times the last digit to remaining number
Repeat until you get a recognizable multiple of 13
```

**Example:** Is 2,197 divisible by 13?
```
219 + (7×4) = 219 + 28 = 247
24 + (7×4) = 24 + 28 = 52
52 ÷ 13 = 4 → ✓ Divisible by 13
```

## 🔥 **PART 2: ADVANCED APPLICATIONS (10:30 AM - 12:00 PM)**

### **Section A: Combined Divisibility Problems (30 minutes)**

#### **Type 1: Finding Numbers with Multiple Divisibility Conditions**

**Problem 1:** Find the smallest 4-digit number divisible by 8, 12, and 15.

**Solution Approach:**
```
Step 1: Find LCM(8, 12, 15)
8 = 2³
12 = 2² × 3
15 = 3 × 5
LCM = 2³ × 3 × 5 = 120

Step 2: Find smallest 4-digit multiple
1000 ÷ 120 = 8.33...
Required number = 120 × 9 = 1080
```

**Problem 2:** How many 3-digit numbers are divisible by both 6 and 8?

**Solution:**
```
Numbers divisible by both 6 and 8 = divisible by LCM(6,8) = 24
Smallest 3-digit: 100 ÷ 24 = 4.16... → 24 × 5 = 120
Largest 3-digit: 999 ÷ 24 = 41.625 → 24 × 41 = 984
Count = 41 - 5 + 1 = 37 numbers
```

4. Count 3-digit numbers divisible by either 8 or 12
5. Find a 4-digit number divisible by 5, 6, 7, 8

<details>
<summary>Solutions</summary>

1. LCM(8,10,12,15)=120, Largest: 99999÷120=833.325 → 120×833=99,960
2. Div by 7: 1001 to 9996 (1285 numbers), Div by 14: half of these = 642, Answer: 643
3. LCM(11,13)=143, 1000÷143=6.99... → 143×7=1,001
4. |A∪B| = |A| + |B| - |A∩B| = 112 + 75 - 37 = 150
5. LCM(5,6,7,8)=840, Examples: 1680, 2520, 3360, etc.
</details>

### **Section B: Divisibility in Large Numbers (30 minutes)**

#### **Technique 1: Breaking Large Numbers**

**For checking divisibility of numbers with 10+ digits:**

**Example:** Is 4,73,82,95,61,38,472 divisible by 11?

```
Break into manageable chunks:
4,7382,9561,3847,2

Method 1: Direct alternating sum
Odd: 2+4+3+6+9+8+7 = 39
Even: 7+8+1+5+2+3+4 = 30
Difference: 39-30 = 9 (not divisible by 11)

Method 2: Grouping technique
Group in pairs from right: 72,84,13,56,29,38,47
Sum = 72-84+13-56+29-38+47 = -17 (not divisible by 11)
```

#### **Technique 2: Using Modular Arithmetic**

**Problem:** Find remainder when 123,456,789 is divided by 7.

```
Break down: 123,456,789 = 123×10⁶ + 456×10³ + 789

Find remainders of powers of 10 mod 7:
10¹ ≡ 3 (mod 7)
10² ≡ 2 (mod 7)
10³ ≡ 6 (mod 7)
10⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 7)

So: 123×1 + 456×6 + 789 (mod 7)
    = 123 + 2736 + 789 (mod 7)
    = 3648 (mod 7)
    = 0 (mod 7)

Therefore, divisible by 7!
```

### **Practice Set E: Large Numbers (15 minutes)**

<details>
<summary>Solutions</summary>

1. Alternating sum: (8+0+2+4+6+8)-(9+1+3+5+7+9) = 28-34 = -6, not divisible
2. Sum of digits: 9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2 = 44, 4+4=8, remainder = 8
3. Sum: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+0+1+2+3 = 51, divisible by 3 ✓
4. 555555555 = 555×1000001, 1000001 = 7×142857+2, check 555×2 = 1110÷7 = 158+4, not divisible
5. Last 3 digits: 999, 999÷8 = 124 remainder 7, so last two digits of quotient = 87
</details>

### **Section C: Pattern Recognition in Divisibility (30 minutes)**

### **Section B: Application Problems (45 minutes)**

#### **Type 1: Code-Based Problems**

**Problem 1:** A 6-digit code must be divisible by 9 and 11. If the code is 4_3_5_, fill the blanks.

**Solution:**
```
Let code be 4a3b5c

For divisibility by 9:
4 + a + 3 + b + 5 + c = 12 + a + b + c must be divisible by 9
So a + b + c = 6, 15, or 24

For divisibility by 11:
(c + b + 4) - (5 + 3 + a) = (c + b - a - 4) must be divisible by 11
So c + b - a = 4 or 15 or -7

Solving: a=2, b=7, c=6 works
Code: 423756
```

#### **Type 2: Finding Digits**

**Problem 2:** In the number 73_4_2, what digits should replace the blanks so the number is divisible by 8 and 9?

**Solution:**
```
Let number be 73a4b2

For divisibility by 8:
Last 3 digits = b2 must be divisible by 8
Possible values of b: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Checking: 032, 152, 352, 552, 752, 952
Valid: b = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

For divisibility by 9:
7 + 3 + a + 4 + b + 2 = 16 + a + b divisible by 9
So a + b = 2, 11, or 20

Testing combinations:
If b = 1, a = 1 → 731412 ✓
If b = 3, a = 8 → 738432 ✓

1. LCM(5,7,9) = 315, number = 315k + 3, smallest > 100 is 318 (but this is 315+3), answer: 318
2. LCM(6,8,14) = 168, number = 168k + 5, for 200-300: k=1, number = 173 (too small), k=2 gives 341 (too large). Recheck: 168+5=173<200, need 168×2+5=341>300. Error in range. Actually need remainder 5, so 221 or 269 works
3. 2024 is divisible by 4, check 2025÷7=289.28..., 2026÷7=289.43..., ..., 2030÷7=290, so 6 years
4. Let first = 7k, second = 7k+1 = 11m, third = 7k+2 = 13n. Solve: k=75 gives 525,526,527
5. Number ≡ 4 (mod 6) and ≡ 9 (mod 11). Chinese remainder theorem: number = 66k + 64, smallest = 64

#### **Speed Patterns to Remember**

**Powers of 2 (mod various numbers):**
```
2¹  2²  2³  2⁴  2⁵  2⁶  (patterns repeat)
mod 3: 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1
mod 5: 2, 4, 3, 1, 2, 4
mod 7: 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1
mod 11: 2, 4, 8, 5, 10, 9, 7, 3, 6, 1
```

**Quick Mental Math for Divisibility:**
```
1001 = 7 × 11 × 13
10101 = 3 × 7 × 13 × 37
111111 = 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 37
```

### **Section B: Advanced Speed Techniques (30 minutes)**

#### **Technique 1: Casting Out**

**Casting out 9s:** Remove any digits that sum to 9
```
Example: 8734926
Cast out: 7+2=9 (remove), 3+6=9 (remove)
Left with: 8+4+9 = 21 → 2+1 = 3
Remainder when divided by 9 is 3
```

**Casting out 11s:** Use alternating sum shortcut
```
Example: 517396
Group in pairs from right: 51|73|96
Alternating sum: 96-73+51 = 74
74 = 11×6 + 8
Remainder is 8
```

#### **Technique 2: Vedic Math Divisibility**

**Ekādhikena Pūrvena (By One More than the Previous)**
```
For divisibility by numbers ending in 9:
÷19: Multiply last digit by 2, add to rest
÷29: Multiply last digit by 3, add to rest
÷39: Multiply last digit by 4, add to rest
```

**Example:** Is 1,729 divisible by 19?
```
172 + (9×2) = 172 + 18 = 190
19 + (0×2) = 19
19 ÷ 19 = 1 ✓
```
