## 📖 **PART 1: CONCEPT MASTERY (9:00 - 10:00 AM)**

### **Section A: Understanding HCF (Highest Common Factor)**

#### **Definition & Concept (15 minutes)**

**What is HCF?**
- The largest number that divides two or more numbers completely
- Also called GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

**Real-world Application:**
- Dividing items into equal groups
- Finding optimal package sizes
- Simplifying fractions

#### **Method 1: Prime Factorization Method**

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. Find prime factors of each number
2. Identify common prime factors
3. Take lowest power of common factors
4. Multiply them together

**Example 1: Find HCF of 36 and 48**
```
36 = 2² × 3²
48 = 2⁴ × 3¹

Common factors: 2 and 3
Lowest powers: 2² and 3¹
HCF = 2² × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12
```

**Practice Set A (Solve in notebook):**
1. HCF(24, 32) = ?
2. HCF(45, 60) = ?
3. HCF(72, 96) = ?

<details>
<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>

1. 24 = 2³ × 3, 32 = 2⁵ → HCF = 2³ = 8
2. 45 = 3² × 5, 60 = 2² × 3 × 5 → HCF = 3 × 5 = 15
3. 72 = 2³ × 3², 96 = 2⁵ × 3 → HCF = 2³ × 3 = 24
</details>

#### **Method 2: Division Method (Euclidean Algorithm)**

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. Divide larger number by smaller
2. Divide divisor by remainder
3. Repeat until remainder = 0
4. Last divisor is HCF

**Example 2: Find HCF of 144 and 180**
```
180 = 144 × 1 + 36
144 = 36 × 4 + 0

HCF = 36
```

**Practice Set B (Use Division Method):**
1. HCF(78, 52) = ?
2. HCF(135, 225) = ?
3. HCF(91, 143) = ?

<details>
<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>

1. 78 = 52×1 + 26, 52 = 26×2 + 0 → HCF = 26
2. 225 = 135×1 + 90, 135 = 90×1 + 45, 90 = 45×2 + 0 → HCF = 45
3. 143 = 91×1 + 52, 91 = 52×1 + 39, 52 = 39×1 + 13, 39 = 13×3 + 0 → HCF = 13
</details>

### **Section B: Understanding LCM (Least Common Multiple)**

#### **Definition & Concept (15 minutes)**

**What is LCM?**
- The smallest number divisible by all given numbers
- The least positive integer that is a multiple of all numbers

**Real-world Application:**
- Finding when events occur together
- Scheduling repeated tasks
- Working with fractions

#### **Method 1: Prime Factorization for LCM**

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. Find prime factors of each number
2. Take highest power of each prime factor
3. Multiply all highest powers together

**Example 3: Find LCM of 12, 15, 20**
```
12 = 2² × 3
15 = 3 × 5
20 = 2² × 5

All prime factors: 2, 3, 5
Highest powers: 2², 3¹, 5¹
LCM = 2² × 3 × 5 = 4 × 3 × 5 = 60
```

**Practice Set C (Find LCM):**
1. LCM(8, 12) = ?
2. LCM(9, 15) = ?
3. LCM(14, 21, 35) = ?

<details>
<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>

1. 8 = 2³, 12 = 2² × 3 → LCM = 2³ × 3 = 24
2. 9 = 3², 15 = 3 × 5 → LCM = 3² × 5 = 45
3. 14 = 2×7, 21 = 3×7, 35 = 5×7 → LCM = 2×3×5×7 = 210
</details>

### **Section C: The HCF-LCM Relationship (15 minutes)**

#### **Golden Formula**
```
For two numbers a and b:
HCF(a,b) × LCM(a,b) = a × b
```

**Important Note:** This formula works ONLY for two numbers!

**Example 4: Using the relationship**
```
If HCF(48, x) = 12 and LCM(48, x) = 144, find x

Solution:
12 × 144 = 48 × x
1728 = 48x
x = 36
```

**Practice Set D (Relationship Problems):**
1. HCF = 6, LCM = 180, one number = 30, find other
2. HCF = 9, LCM = 270, one number = 54, find other
3. Two numbers are 24 and 36, verify the HCF-LCM formula

<details>
<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>

1. 6 × 180 = 30 × x → x = 1080/30 = 36
2. 9 × 270 = 54 × x → x = 2430/54 = 45
3. HCF(24,36) = 12, LCM(24,36) = 72 → 12×72 = 864 = 24×36 ✓
</details>

48 = 2⁴ × 3
72 = 2³ × 3²
108 = 2² × 3³

Find HCF(609, 957)
609 = 3 × 7 × 29
957 = 3 × 11 × 29

<details>
<summary>Detailed Solutions</summary>

1. 23 × 1449 = 161 × x → x = 207
2. Numbers = k, 2k, 3k where HCF = k = 12 → 12, 24, 36
3. Notice: 35-7=28, 56-28=28, 91-63=28 → LCM(35,56,91) - 28 = 2520-28 = 2492
4. Let numbers be 5a, 5b where HCF(a,b)=1 → 5a×5b = 5×495 → ab=99, a+b=20 → a=11,b=9 → Numbers: 55,45
5. LCM(3,4,5,6)+1 = 60+1 = 61, but 61÷7 leaves remainder → Try 60k+1: 121÷7=17+2, 181÷7=25+6, 241÷7=34+3, 301÷7=43+0 ✓
