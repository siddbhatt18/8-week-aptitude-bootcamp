### Day 1 – Week 1  
**Focus:** Number System Foundations + Divisibility (Part 1)  
**Goal by end of Day 1:**  
- You clearly know the main types of numbers (natural, whole, integers, primes, composites, evens, odds).  
- You can apply divisibility rules for **2, 3, 5, 9, 10** quickly and correctly.  
- You can do a short speed drill on divisibility without getting stuck.

Total time: **~2 hours** (you can scale each block up/down by ~10 minutes).

---

## Block 0 – Setup (5 minutes)

1. Keep ready:
   - One notebook (or digital notes) titled **“Aptitude – Week 1”**.
   - Pen + rough sheets.
   - Timer (phone/online).
   - One resource for questions (any one is enough):
     - Book: R.S. Aggarwal / Arun Sharma  
     - Website: IndiaBix / PrepInsta / GeeksforGeeks (Quantitative Aptitude section).

2. Make 3 headings on the first page:
   - **Concepts**
   - **Examples**
   - **Mistakes & Doubts**

You’ll fill them as you go.

## Block 1 – Concepts: Number System Basics (25–30 minutes)

### 1.1 Learn / Revise Definitions (10–15 min)

Write these in your **Concepts** section in your own words:

1. **Natural Numbers (N):**  
   - Counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, …  
   - Note: 0 is *not* natural.

2. **Whole Numbers (W):**  
   - All natural numbers + 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, …

3. **Integers (Z):**  
   - …, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, … (positive, negative and zero)

4. **Rational Numbers (Q):**  
   - Numbers that can be written as p/q where p, q are integers and q ≠ 0.  
   - Examples: 1/2, −5/3, 4 = 4/1, 0.25 = 1/4, 0.333… = 1/3.

5. **Irrational Numbers:**  
   - Cannot be expressed as p/q with integers.  
   - Non-terminating, non-repeating decimals.  
   - Examples: √2, √3, π, e.

6. **Prime Numbers (p):**  
   - Greater than 1, with exactly two distinct factors: 1 and itself.  
   - Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …

7. **Composite Numbers:**  
   - Greater than 1, and *not* prime (more than two factors).  
   - Examples: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, …

8. **Even & Odd:**
   - Even: divisible by 2 → last digit in {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}.  
   - Odd: not divisible by 2 → last digit in {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.

9. **Prime Numbers up to 50** (memorize / revise):  
   - 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47  

   Write this list once and read it 3–4 times. You’ll use it for factorization and HCF/LCM later.

> Tip: Don’t spend too much time; just get comfortable with the names and examples.

### 1.2 Quick Self-check (5–10 min)

On rough paper, write answers without looking at notes:

1. Classify each as natural / whole / integer / rational / irrational:  
   a) −3  
   b) 0  
   c) 5  
   d) 0.25  
   e) √2  

2. Decide if each is prime, composite, or neither:  
   a) 1  
   b) 2  
   c) 15  
   d) 37  
   e) 49  

Then check with your notes and correct any confusion. If something feels unclear, write it under **Mistakes & Doubts**.

## Block 2 – Concepts: Divisibility Rules (2, 3, 5, 9, 10) (20–25 minutes)

### 2.1 Learn / Revise the Rules (10–15 min)

Write in **Concepts** section with one example each:

1. **Divisibility by 2**  
   - Condition: Last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 (even).  
   - Example: 246 (last digit 6 → divisible by 2).

2. **Divisibility by 5**  
   - Condition: Last digit is 0 or 5.  
   - Example: 735 (last digit 5 → divisible by 5).

3. **Divisibility by 10**  
   - Condition: Last digit is 0.  
   - Example: 420 (last digit 0 → divisible by 10).

4. **Divisibility by 3**  
   - Condition: Sum of digits is divisible by 3.  
   - Example: 246 → 2 + 4 + 6 = 12, and 12 is divisible by 3 → number is divisible by 3.

5. **Divisibility by 9**  
   - Condition: Sum of digits is divisible by 9.  
   - Example: 729 → 7 + 2 + 9 = 18, and 18 is divisible by 9 → number is divisible by 9.

> Note: Every number divisible by 9 is also divisible by 3 (but not vice versa).

### 2.2 Simple Practice (10 minutes)

Pick **8–10 random numbers** (you can write them yourself or pick from a page):

Example set:  
128, 345, 900, 731, 504, 999, 120, 407

For each number, make a small table like:

| Number | /2? | /3? | /5? | /9? | /10? |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| 128    |     |     |     |     |      |

Fill “Y” (yes) or “N” (no) by applying rules *without actual division*.

Then quickly verify a couple using actual division or calculator if needed, just to build trust in rules.

Mark any rule you applied wrongly in **Mistakes & Doubts** (for example, if you confuse 3 and 9).

---

## Block 3 – Guided Practice Set (Core Drill) (35–40 minutes)

Use a book/website or use the practice below. Try to solve by yourself before checking solutions.

### 3.1 Very Basic Classification (5–10 min)

Write the answers clearly in your notebook.

1. Classify each as natural, whole, integer, rational, irrational:  
   a) 7  
   b) 0  
   c) −12  
   d) 3/5  
   e) 0.101010… (repeating)  
   f) √5  

2. Identify prime / composite / neither:  
   a) 0  
   b) 1  
   c) 2  
   d) 13  
   e) 21  
   f) 39  

Check answers from your notes or a reliable source after attempting all.

### 3.2 Divisibility Questions – Beginner (15 minutes)

Apply only rules for 2, 3, 5, 9, 10.

1. For each number, state whether it is divisible by 2, 3, 5, 9, 10:

   a) 246  
   b) 735  
   c) 180  
   d) 507  
   e) 1005  

2. “How many numbers between 1 and 50 are divisible by 3?”  
   - Hint: First multiple of 3? Last multiple of 3 ≤ 50? Use: count = (last − first)/step + 1.

3. “How many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 5?”  
   - Same method as above.

4. “How many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by both 2 and 5?”  
   - Think: number must be divisible by LCM(2,5) = 10 → count multiples of 10 up to 100.

> After solving, quickly verify with a calculator or mental check.

---

### 3.3 Divisibility Questions – Small Step Up (10–15 minutes)

1. “A number is divisible by 2 and 3 but not by 5. Which of the following could it be?”  
   (You can make up or pick options, e.g., 30, 36, 60, 90. Note: 30, 60, 90 are divisible by 5; 36 is not.)

2. “Find the smallest 3-digit number that is divisible by 3.”  
   - Hint: Smallest 3-digit number is 100. Find first multiple of 3 ≥ 100.

3. “Find the largest 3-digit number divisible by 9.”  
   - Hint: Largest 3-digit number is 999. Check divisibility by 9 or go downwards.

4. “How many numbers between 1 and 200 are divisible by 9?”  
   - Method: Find 9, 18, 27, …, 198; count them.

Record any question that you couldn’t solve in first attempt under **Mistakes & Doubts** with a brief note like “Didn’t know how to count multiples” etc.

## Block 4 – Speed Drill: Divisibility Snapshot (10–15 minutes)

**Aim:** Start building speed without sacrificing accuracy.

1. Take a fresh rough sheet.
2. Write **10 random 3-digit numbers**. Example:
   - 124, 135, 250, 399, 420, 521, 678, 705, 840, 999  
   (You can also let a friend read out numbers or use random page numbers.)

3. Set a **timer for 10 minutes**.

4. For **each number**, write its divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 9, 10 as quickly as possible, like:

   - 124 → /2: Y, /3: N, /5: N, /9: N, /10: N  
   - 135 → /2: N, /3: Y, /5: Y, /9: N, /10: N  
   - … and so on

5. After 10 minutes, stop, even if you aren’t done (note how many you finished).

6. Check your answers calmly:
   - Any pattern of mistakes? (e.g., mixing 3 and 9, forgetting to check last digit for 5)  
   - Note these patterns in **Mistakes & Doubts**.

Repeat this same type of drill every 2–3 days; it gets much faster quickly.

## Block 5 – Reflection & Summary (10–15 minutes)

### 5.1 Quick Written Summary (5–10 min)

In your notebook, under **Summary Day 1**, write in your own words:

1. The definitions you are now comfortable with:
   - “Natural numbers are…”, “Integers are…”, etc.
2. Divisibility rules you can apply instantly (2,3,5,9,10).
3. One example of:
   - A prime number.  
   - A composite number.  
   - A number divisible by 2, 3, and 5.  
   - A number divisible by 9 but not by 5.

### 5.2 Mark Weak Spots (5 minutes)

Look at your **Mistakes & Doubts** section and highlight:

- Any confusion in:
  - Prime vs composite.  
  - Counting multiples.  
  - Divisibility by 3 vs 9.

These become your **first 10–15 minutes of revision on Day 2** before learning new concepts (4, 6, 8, 11 divisibility + intro to LCM/HCF).

---

## Optional Extra Practice (If You Have More Time)

If you still have 20–30 minutes and feel fresh:

- Go to any aptitude site (IndiaBix → Quantitative → Number System → “Divisibility” / “Numbers – Basic”).  
- Solve **10–15 additional questions** focused only on:
  - Number classification  
  - Divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 9, 10  

Mark 3 that you found most interesting or tricky, and rewrite them with solutions in your **Examples** section.

---

If you tell me roughly how long you actually studied and which part felt hardest today (divisibility rules vs types of numbers vs counting multiples), I can slightly adjust Day 2’s load to match your pace.
