Day 1 is about building a rock‑solid foundation with **percentages** so that later topics (profit–loss, DI, SI/CI, etc.) feel natural and fast.

Below is a **structured Day‑1 guide (about 2.5–3 hours)** with:
- Clear phases (learn → guided examples → practice → speed drill → reflection).
- **Practice questions of increasing difficulty**, with answers at the end so you can self‑check.

You can adjust timings if you have more/less time.

## Overview: Day 1 Focus

**Main objectives:**
1. Understand what percentages really mean.
2. Be fast with:
   - Fraction ↔ percentage ↔ decimal conversions.
   - Finding `% of a number` mentally.
3. Start forming “mental tables” and shortcuts.

**Core ideas for Day 1:**
- `x% = x / 100`
- `x% of y = (x/100) × y`
- Common %–fraction equivalents (25% = 1/4, 12.5% = 1/8, etc.)
- Quick mental tricks for 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5% etc.

---

## Block 1 (30–40 min): Core Concepts & Quick Notes

Sit with a notebook. Your goal here is to **understand and write** the key facts in your own words.

### 1. What is a percentage?

- “Per cent” = per 100.
- 30% literally means 30 out of 100 → `30/100`.
- 75% = 75 out of 100 = `75/100 = 3/4`.

Write this in your notebook:
- `% → fraction:` divide by 100 and simplify.
- `fraction → %:` multiply by 100 and add `%`.

### 2. Must‑know fraction ↔ percentage pairs

Write and **say them out loud** while you write:

- 1/2 = 50%
- 1/3 ≈ 33⅓% ; 2/3 ≈ 66⅔%
- 1/4 = 25% ; 3/4 = 75%
- 1/5 = 20% ; 2/5 = 40% ; 3/5 = 60% ; 4/5 = 80%
- 1/8 = 12.5% ; 3/8 = 37.5% ; 5/8 = 62.5% ; 7/8 = 87.5%
- 1/10 = 10% ; 3/10 = 30%
- 1/20 = 5% ; 1/25 = 4%

You don’t need all perfectly memorized today, but start getting familiar.

### 3. Quick mental rules

Write this “toolkit” clearly:

- `x% of y = (x/100) × y`
- 10% of a number → move decimal 1 place left.  
  - 10% of 640 = 64.
- 1% of a number → divide by 100.  
  - 1% of 640 = 6.4.
- 5% = half of 10%.  
  - 5% of 640 = half of 64 = 32.
- 25% = quarter of number.  
  - 25% of 360 = 360/4 = 90.
- 50% = half; 75% = 3/4; 12.5% = 1/8, etc.

---

## Block 2 (15–20 min): Guided Examples (Do Them Slowly)

Do these in your notebook. Show steps. Make sure you understand *why* each step works.

### Guided Examples

1. **Find 25% of 360.**  
   - 25% = 1/4 → 360 ÷ 4.

2. **Find 12.5% of 480.**  
   - 12.5% = 1/8 → 480 ÷ 8.

3. **Convert 0.4 to % and to fraction.**  
   - Hint: 0.4 × 100.

4. **Convert 45% to a fraction in simplest form.**

5. **Find 18% of 250.**  
   - Think: 10% of 250, then 5%, then 3%.

6. **Convert 3/8 to %.**  
   - Convert to decimal or use 1/8 = 12.5%.

7. **Find 7.5% of 320.**  
   - 7.5% = 0.075 or (15%)/2.

Don’t check any solution until you try all yourself. Then compare with the answer section at the end.

## Block 3 (35–45 min): Structured Practice – Increasing Difficulty

Keep a rough 2‑minute cap per easy question; 3 minutes for the harder ones.

### Part A – Direct `% of a number` (Beginner)

Do these *without* long multiplication if possible (use the mental tricks):

1. 10% of 780  
2. 5% of 640  
3. 20% of 350  
4. 15% of 240  
5. 2.5% of 800  
6. 1% of 1250  
7. 0.5% of 600  
8. 35% of 200  
9. 70% of 90  
10. 12% of 450

Think:
- For 20% → double 10%.  
- For 15% → 10% + 5%.  
- For 2.5% → 1/40 of the number or half of 5%.

### Part B – Conversions (Intermediate)

**B1. Fraction → Percentage**

Convert to percentage:

11. 1/5  
12. 2/5  
13. 7/10  
14. 3/4  
15. 7/8  
16. 9/20  

**B2. Percentage → Fraction (simplify)**

17. 32%  
18. 62.5%  
19. 45%  
20. 8%  

**B3. Decimal ↔ Percentage**

21. 0.06 to %  
22. 0.375 to %  
23. 1.2 to %  
24. 135% to decimal  
25. 0.045 to %

### Part C – Slightly Word‑Based (Intermediate)

26. Out of 800 students in a college, 35% are girls. How many girls are there?  
27. A person saves 12.5% of his monthly income of ₹24,000. How much does he save?  
28. A shopkeeper offers a discount of 20% on a shirt marked at ₹750. What is the selling price?  
29. In a class test, a student scored 18 marks out of 25. What percentage of marks did he score?  
30. A student answered 36 questions correctly out of 45. What % of questions did he answer correctly?

Focus on **translating the English into a % calculation** quickly.

## Block 4 (15–20 min): Speed Drill – Build Calculation Fluency

This is specifically to improve speed; allow yourself to write minimal steps.

### Drill 1 – Percent Table

Take a fresh page. Write these numbers across the top:

`120, 250, 360, 480, 640, 800, 900, 1250, 1500, 2000`

For each number, quickly write beneath it:

- 10%, 5%, 1%, 25%

Example table structure (you fill in the values):

- 120 → 10% = ___ ; 5% = ___ ; 1% = ___ ; 25% = ___  
- 250 → …  
- …

Set a timer for **10–12 minutes** and see if you can complete all.

### Drill 2 – Mixed Mental Quickies

Try to do these mentally first, then verify on paper:

1. 30% of 80  
2. 12.5% of 320  
3. 37.5% of 160  
4. 5% of 960  
5. 22% of 450 (approximate first, then exact)

---

## Block 5 (10–15 min): Reflection & Error Review

In your notebook, create a section called **“Day 1 Summary”**.

1. **List 3 things you are now comfortable with**, e.g.:
   - “10% / 5% / 1% tricks.”
   - “25% as 1/4.”
   - “Converting simple fractions like 1/5, 1/4 to %.”

2. **List 2 things that still felt slow or confusing**, e.g.:
   - “Decimals to percentages.”
   - “Percentages like 37.5%.”

3. From the practice above:
   - Mark each question you got wrong or took >3 minutes on.
   - For each such question, write one line: “I made a mistake because ___ (rushed / misread / didn’t know fraction–% / arithmetic).”

This reflection guides what you quickly revise on **Day 2 warm‑up**.

## Answer Key (Check Only After Attempting)

### Guided Examples

1. 25% of 360 = 360/4 = **90**  
2. 12.5% of 480 = 480/8 = **60**  
3. 0.4 = 0.4 × 100% = **40%**; as fraction 0.4 = 4/10 = **2/5**  
4. 45% = 45/100 = **9/20**  
5. 18% of 250 = (18/100)×250 = (9/50)×250 = 9×5 = **45**  
6. 3/8 = (3 × 12.5%) = **37.5%**  
7. 7.5% of 320 = (7.5/100)×320 = 0.075×320 = 24 (or 15% of 320 = 48, half of that) → **24**

---

### Part A – Direct % of a Number

1. 10% of 780 = 78  
2. 5% of 640 = 32  
3. 20% of 350 = 70  
4. 15% of 240 = 36 (10% = 24, 5% = 12, sum = 36)  
5. 2.5% of 800 = 20 (1% = 8 → 2.5% = 2.5×8 = 20)  
6. 1% of 1250 = 12.5  
7. 0.5% of 600 = 3 (1% = 6 → 0.5% = 3)

27. 12.5% of 24,000 = (1/8)×24,000 = 3,000  
28. 20% discount on 750 = 0.8×750 = 600 (SP = ₹600)  
29. 18/25 = 72/100 = **72%**  
30. 36/45 = 4/5 = **80%**

---

### Speed Drill Mixed (for reference)

1. 30% of 80 = 24  
2. 12.5% of 320 = 40  
3. 37.5% of 160 = (3/8 of 160) = 60  
4. 5% of 960 = 48  
5. 22% of 450 = 99

If you’d like, next I can structure **Day 2** in the same way but focusing on **percentage increase/decrease and successive percentage changes**, again with a graded problem set for accuracy and speed.
