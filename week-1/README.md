Below is a **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 1**, focusing on **Percentages, Ratios, and Averages**. It’s structured so you always:

- Learn → See 1–2 examples → Try problems yourself → Reflect on mistakes.  
- Are gently pushed to attempt problems **before** seeing any solution.  

Assume you have **2.5–3 hours/day**. Adjust counts if you have more/less time.

## Day 1 – Percentages: Basics & Conversions

**Main goal:** Become very comfortable with converting between fractions, decimals, and percentages, and calculating simple percentages mentally.

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

Read/learn the following (from any basic aptitude book or online notes):

1. Definitions:
   - Percentage = “per hundred”.
   - Relation:  
     - `x% = x / 100`  
     - `Fraction → %`: multiply by 100.  
     - `% → Fraction`: divide by 100 and simplify.

2. Common fraction–percentage equivalents (memorize):
   - 1/2 = 50%  
   - 1/3 ≈ 33.33% ; 2/3 ≈ 66.67%  
   - 1/4 = 25%, 3/4 = 75%  
   - 1/5 = 20%, 2/5 = 40%, 3/5 = 60%, 4/5 = 80%  
   - 1/8 = 12.5%, 3/8 = 37.5%, 5/8 = 62.5%, 7/8 = 87.5%  
   - 1/10 = 10%, 1/20 = 5%  

3. Simple percentage of a number:
   - `x% of y = (x/100) * y`  
   - Useful mental shortcuts:
     - 10%: move decimal one place left.  
     - 5%: half of 10%.  
     - 1%: divide by 100, etc.

### 2. Guided Examples (10–15 min)

Work through 5–6 example problems **step by step**, writing all steps.

Example patterns to cover:
1. Find 25% of 360.  
2. Convert 0.4 to percentage.  
3. Convert 45% to a fraction in simplest form.  
4. Find 15% of 640 quickly without calculator.  
5. What is 12.5% of 480?

Try to pause after reading each question and **predict how you’ll approach it** before looking at the written solution.

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner (35–45 min)

Target: **15 problems** from PYQs or basic sheets, of the following types:

- Type A: “Find x% of y”
  - Example: 18% of 250, 7% of 900, 2.5% of 1600, etc.
- Type B: Convert:
  - Fractions to % (e.g., 3/5, 7/8, 11/20).  
  - % to fractions (e.g., 35%, 62.5%, 12.5%, 44%).  
  - Decimals to % (0.25, 0.08, 1.2) and back.

**Rules for yourself:**
- Allow **2 minutes max** per question.  
- If you’re stuck, write what you *think* is the first step, then move on. Don’t get stuck too long.

### 4. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

Take **one page**, write:

- A random list of 10 numbers (like 120, 450, 800, 640, etc.).  
- For each, quickly compute:
  - 10%, 5%, 1%, 25%.

Time yourself (aim: finish in **10–12 min**). This builds **mental calculation speed**.

### 5. Reflection (10–15 min)

On a notebook page, write:

- Which conversions feel easy now?  
- Which ones took too long or confused you? (e.g., fractions like 7/8)  
- Choose **2 items** you’ll quickly review tomorrow (e.g., “need to memorize fraction–% table for denominators 3, 5, 8”).

---

## Day 2 – Percentages: Increase/Decrease & Successive Changes

**Main goal:** Handle real-life style % changes (salary, price, population).

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

Study:

1. **Percentage change**:
   - % change = `(New – Old) / Old × 100`
   - If new > old → increase, else decrease.

2. **Successive percentage changes**:
   - Increase by a%, then by b% → overall factor: `(1 + a/100)(1 + b/100)`  
     Overall % change = `[(1 + a/100)(1 + b/100) – 1] × 100`
   - For an increase then decrease, one factor is (1 + a/100), the other is (1 – b/100).

3. Concept of **multipliers**:
   - Increase by 20% → multiply by 1.2  
   - Decrease by 10% → multiply by 0.9  
   - Discount 25% → multiply by 0.75

### 2. Guided Examples (15–20 min)

Work through ~6 examples of increasing difficulty:

1. Price rises from 400 to 460. Find % increase.  
2. Price drops from 500 to 425. % decrease.  
3. Salary increased by 10% then 20%. Overall increase %?  
4. Price discounted by 20%, then further 10%. Net change?  
5. A population of 20,000 grows by 5% per year for 2 years. Final population?

Write out:
- Formula used.  
- Values substituted.  
- Short mental check (does answer make sense? increase > 0, etc.).

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner to Intermediate (40–50 min)

Pick **15–20** problems from PYQs on “percentage increase/decrease”:

Split them:
- 6–8 direct change (new, old given, find %).  
- 4–6 successive changes.  
- 4–6 word problems (price, population, marks, etc.).

**Thinking guideline (for each problem):**
- Step 1: Identify “Old” and “New.”  
- Step 2: Write down formula before plugging numbers.  
- Step 3: Try to use fraction/multiplier thinking (especially for nice numbers like 10%, 20%, 25%).

### 4. Challenge Problems – Advanced Style (15–20 min)

Try 3–5 reverse/successive problems where you don’t see solutions until you’ve *really tried*:

Example patterns:
1. After a 20% increase, a number becomes 360. What was original?  
2. A number is first increased by 20% and then decreased by 20%. Is the result same as the original? If not, what is % change?  
3. A population becomes 24200 after 10% increase in year 1 and 10% in year 2. Find initial population.

Give yourself **3–4 minutes per question**. If stuck:
- Write down what you know (final value, percentage, etc.).  
- Try to express the initial value as “x” and set up one equation.

### 5. Reflection (10–15 min)

Answer for yourself:
- Can you fluently switch to multipliers (1.1, 0.8, etc.) instead of re-deriving every time?  
- Where did you hesitate: formula recall or arithmetic?

---

## Day 3 – Ratios & Proportion: Basics

**Main goal:** Understand what ratios mean and how to use them to divide quantities.

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

Learn:

1. Ratio as a comparison: `a : b` means `a/b`.  
2. Scaling a ratio:
   - 2:3 = 4:6 = 10:15 (multiply/divide both sides by same number).  
3. Simplifying a ratio:
   - Use GCD to reduce (e.g., 24:32 → divide by 8 → 3:4).  
4. Using ratios to divide a quantity:
   - If sum is S and ratio is a:b → parts are:
     - A’s share = `S × a/(a + b)`  
     - B’s share = `S × b/(a + b)`

### 2. Guided Examples (15–20 min)

Work through 5–6 examples:

1. Simplify 45:60.  
2. Simplify 0.6 : 0.9.  
3. Divide 600 in ratio 2:3.  
4. A and B get a profit of 1500 in ratio 3:2. Find shares.  
5. Ratio of marks of A and B is 4:5. A scores 80. How much does B score?

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner (35–45 min)

Target: **15 questions**:

- 6–8 ratio simplifications:
  - Integers, decimals, fractions (e.g., 1/2 : 3/4).  
- 7–9 splitting quantities by ratio:
  - Money, profit, chocolate, etc.

**Try this structure:**
- For each split problem:
  - Step 1: Find sum of ratio parts.  
  - Step 2: Find value of one part (`Total / sum_of_parts`).  
  - Step 3: Multiply to get each share.

### 4. Mini Speed Drill (10–15 min)

Quickly practice simplification:

- Make a list of 10 raw ratios (like 18:27, 56:72, 120:80, etc.).  
- Time yourself to simplify all to simplest form.  
Aim: complete in **10 minutes** or less.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Ask:
- Do you always remember to combine ratio parts (a + b, a + b + c)?  
- Did any question force you to think beyond a direct formula (e.g., fractions in ratio)?

---

## Day 4 – Ratios with Percentages & Intro to Averages (Simple)

**Main goal:** Combine ratio understanding with percentages, then start basic average problems.

### 1. Quick Revision (10–15 min)

Spend 10–15 min revising:
- Fraction–percent conversions (Day 1).  
- Ratio division method (Day 3).

### 2. Concept Learning – Ratios + % (20–25 min)

Study examples where ratios and percentages mix, like:

1. Salaries in ratio 3:5. If total salary is ₹8000, what is each person’s salary?  
2. If A’s salary is 20% more than B’s, what is ratio A:B?  
   - Let B = 100, A = 120 → ratio 120:100 = 6:5.

Key ideas:
- Sometimes easiest to **assume a base value** (like 100) for % questions and convert to ratios.  
- Or convert ratio to %, whichever feels simpler.

### 3. Guided Mixed Examples (15–20 min)

Work through 6–7 problems:

- Ratio → amounts (given total)  
- % → ratio (e.g., A is 25% more than B; A:B?).  
- Combining ratio + % change (e.g., both salaries increased by 10%, what happens to ratio?).

### 4. Concept Learning – Averages Basics (20–25 min)

Learn definitions:

1. Average = (Sum of all terms) / (Number of terms).  
2. From average, you can get sum:
   - Sum = Average × Number of terms.  
3. Simple scenarios:
   - Given average and all but one value → find missing value.  
   - Effect on average when a number is added/removed:
     - New sum and new count → new average.

### 5. Independent Practice – Averages (Beginner) (30–35 min)

Solve **12–15 questions**, types:

- Given a list of numbers, find average (3–4 Q).  
- Given average and n, find sum (3–4 Q).  
- Given average and all but one number, find the missing one (4–6 Q).

Example patterns:
- “Average of 5 numbers is 26. If their sum is S, find S.”  
- “Average of 4 numbers is 20. Three numbers are 12, 18, 22. Find the 4th.”  
- “Average of 10 numbers is 15. One number 25 is removed. Find new average.”

### 6. Reflection (10 min)

Note:
- Are you comfortable jumping between sum and average?  
- Which was trickier: ratios+%, or basic averages?

---

## Day 5 – Averages: Effects of Adding/Removing/Replacing

**Main goal:** Understand how average changes when you modify the data set.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Study the following patterns:

1. **Adding a number**:
   - New sum = old sum + added number.  
   - New count = old count + 1.  
   - New average = new sum / new count.

2. **Removing a number**:
   - New sum = old sum – removed number.  
   - New count = old count – 1.  

3. **Replacing a number**:
   - New sum = old sum – old_number + new_number.  

4. Classic type:
   - “Average of x items is A. If one more item with value B is added, new average becomes C. Find B.”  

### 2. Guided Examples (15–20 min)

Do 6–8 progressively harder problems:

1. “Average of 5 numbers is 20. Another number 30 is added. Find new average.”  
2. “Average of 6 numbers is 15. One number 9 is removed. New average?”  
3. “Average of 10 numbers is 18. If one number is 30, what is average of remaining 9?”  
4. “Average of 8 numbers is 21. A new number is added and average becomes 22. Find the new number.”

For each, write:
- Step 1: Write known sum (avg × count).  
- Step 2: Update sum & count.  
- Step 3: Compute new average or missing number.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **15 problems**, including:

- 6–8: add/remove type.  
- 3–4: replace one number.  
- 3–4: word problems (e.g., average age of group, adding a new person, etc.).

Try to **avoid algebra in first attempt**:
- Use direct “sum & count” logic instead of writing long equations.  
- Only use algebra when absolutely needed.

### 4. Short Challenge Set (15–20 min)

Try 4–5 harder-style average questions (check any placement PYQ set):

Examples to look for:
1. “Average of 11 observations is 50. If the average of first 6 is 48 and of last 6 is 52, find the 6th observation.”  
2. “Average of marks of 30 students is 40. Average of boys is 45 and that of girls is 35. Find number of boys/girls.”

These introduce:
- Overlapping groups.  
- Weighted average thinking.

Give yourself **4 minutes per question**. Try fully first; only then check solution.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Ask:
- When you see an average question, do you **immediately** think: “Let me find the sum first”?  
- Did any problem force you to draw a small diagram or table? That’s good—shows you’re reasoning, not memorizing.

---

## Day 6 – Integration: Percentages + Ratios + Averages (Practice Day)

**Main goal:** Mix everything learned so far and build **speed + accuracy**.

### 1. Quick Formula Revision (15–20 min)

On one page, quickly write (from memory):

- % change formula.  
- Successive % change multiplier logic.  
- Ratio division method.  
- Average = sum / count; sum = average × count.

Fill any gaps by revisiting notes for 5–10 min.

### 2. Mixed Problem Set 1 – Untimed (35–45 min)

Do **15–20 problems**, mix of:

- 5 percentage (including 2 successive change).  
- 5 ratio (including at least 2 that mix money/marks with ratios).  
- 5–10 average (varied difficulty).

For each problem:
- Before solving, **label** it in the margin: “%”, “R”, or “Avg”. This trains classification.  
- After solving, star any question where:
  - You hesitated to start.  
  - You used a very long method you suspect can be shorter.

### 3. Mixed Problem Set 2 – Timed (25–30 min)

Now take **another 10–12 problems** (similar mix) and:

- Set a **25–30 min timer**.  
- Keep a simple log:
  - Mark each question with how long you *estimate* you spent (just rough: <1 min, ~2 min, >3 min).  

Goal:
- Don’t exceed **2–2.5 minutes** on “standard” questions.  
- If stuck beyond that, circle and move on—simulate real test behavior.

### 4. Targeted Error Review (20–25 min)

Revisit:
- All wrong questions.  
- All questions you left or took very long on.

For each, answer:
1. Did I understand the concept? If no → mark topic for revision (e.g., “successive % is weak”).  
2. Did I make a calculation error? If yes → do **1–2 similar quick calculations** to fix it.  
3. Was it a reading/attention issue? If yes → underline or highlight keywords in the question and re-read.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write 3 bullet points:
- One thing you’re now *confident* about (e.g., “basic % of a number is easy now”).  
- One thing that feels “okay but slow.”  
- One thing that still feels confusing.

---

## Day 7 – Light Revision + Mini Mock of Week 1 Topics

**Main goal:** Consolidate Week 1 and simulate a mini test to see progress.

### 1. Concept Recap (20–30 min)

Go through your notes and quickly revise:

- Fraction–percentage table (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, etc.).  
- % change & successive changes.  
- Ratio basics and how to split a total.  
- Average basics and effect of adding/removing items.

You don’t need to *re-learn*, just **scan and recall**.

### 2. Mini Mock Test – Quant Basics (40–45 min)

Prepare (or select from a PYQ source):  
**25 questions total**:

- 8 percentage questions  
  - 3 direct (% of number)  
  - 3 increase/decrease  
  - 2 successive/ reverse style  
- 8 ratio & proportion questions  
  - 4 basic + 4 with money/marks or mixing with percentages  
- 9 average questions  
  - 4 basic + 5 involving add/remove/replace or group averages

**Rules:**
- Time limit: **40–45 minutes** continuous, no breaks.  
- Simulate exam conditions: no phone except for timer, no checking solutions midway.  
- Keep water, pen, rough sheet ready beforehand.

### 3. Mock Analysis (30–40 min)

After finishing:

1. **Score yourself**:
   - Correct, wrong, unattempted.  
   - Compute accuracy: correct / attempted.

2. **Error categories**:
   - Conceptual error (didn’t know/recall right approach).  
   - Calculation error.  
   - Misread/misinterpreted question.

3. For any concept error:
   - Re-solve the question from scratch with the correct method.  
   - If still unclear, reread that topic’s explanation.

4. Pick **3 questions** you found interesting/difficult and:
   - Write a short “solution summary” in your notebook:
     - What was given?  
     - What was required?  
     - Key idea/shortcut that solved it.

This helps you build a **personal revision book** of good problems.

### 4. Weekly Reflection (10–15 min)

Answer **in writing**:

1. Which topic do I find:
   - Easiest so far?  
   - Most confusing (and why)?  

2. What will I do differently next week?
   - Example: “Spend 10 min daily on mental arithmetic.”  
   - Or: “Do 5 extra questions on successive % each day.”

3. Confidence rating (1–10) in:
   - Percentages  
   - Ratios  
   - Averages  

This reflection helps you start Week 2 aware of your strengths and weaknesses.

---

If you want next, I can create a **Day 8–Day 14 (Week 2)** daily plan focusing on Profit & Loss, SI/CI, and reinforcing Week 1 topics with specific problem quotas and difficulty progression.
