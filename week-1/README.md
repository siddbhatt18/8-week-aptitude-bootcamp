## General Structure (Daily Template)

Each day will follow this pattern:

1. **Concept (20–30 min)**  
   Learn/refresh formulas and methods.

2. **Guided Practice (30–40 min)**  
   Solve 10–15 questions of the day’s focus topic.

3. **Mixed Drill (15–20 min)**  
   5–8 questions mixing previous days’ topics + basic simplification.

4. **Review & Notes (10–15 min)**  
   Check answers, mark mistakes, and write a 1–2 line correction note.

Use any good aptitude site (IndiaBix, PrepInsta, GfG, etc.) and filter by topic:  
- “Percentages”  
- “Ratio and Proportion”  
- “Averages”  
- “Simplification”

## Day 1 – Percentages Basics

### 1. Concepts (20–30 min)
- What is %; relation between % and fractions/decimals.  
- Conversions to memorize:
  - 1/2 = 50%  
  - 1/3 ≈ 33.33%  
  - 1/4 = 25%  
  - 1/5 = 20%  
  - 1/8 = 12.5%  
  - 1/10 = 10%
- Compute:
  - “x% of y”  
  - “x is what % of y”

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **10–15 questions** (beginner level).

Problem types:
1. Direct % of a number  
   - e.g., 25% of 480, 12.5% of 320.
2. Finding % relationship  
   - “What % of 80 is 20?”  
   - “60 is what % of 240?”
3. Increase/decrease by a single %  
   - “Increase 300 by 20%”  
   - “Decrease 500 by 15%”

**Key Concepts Reinforced**
- Quick mental conversion between % and fractions.  
- Comfortable with multiplying/dividing by 100.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 3–4 easy percentage questions.  
- 3–4 basic simplification questions like:  
  - 15 × 8 – 45 ÷ 9  
  - 20% of 200 + 0.3 × 50  

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- For every wrong question, write:  
  - “Thought: …, Correct: …”  
- List 3–5 %–fraction pairs you found useful today.

## Day 2 – Percentages: Increase/Decrease & Successive Changes

### 1. Concepts (20–30 min)
- % Increase/Decrease:
  - New value = old × (1 ± r/100).
- Successive % changes:
  - Net% = a + b + (ab/100).  
- Back-calculating original price from final price.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 questions** (beginner→intermediate).

Problem types:
1. Single increase/decrease  
   - “Price of a pen increases from 40 to 50. Find % increase.”
2. Successive changes  
   - “Price ↑ by 20% then ↓ by 10%. Net % change?”
3. Finding original from final  
   - “After 20% discount, price is Rs. 800. What was marked price?”
4. Population/salary type  
   - “Population increases by 10% yearly. If it is 24200 after 2 years, find population 2 years ago.”

**Reinforces**
- Thinking in multipliers: 20% increase → ×1.2; 10% decrease → ×0.9.  
- Using successive change formula instead of step-by-step always.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 4–5 questions: mixture of Day 1 + Day 2 percentage types.  
- 2–3 simplification questions with % and decimals.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Note 2–3 common traps (e.g., using 20% directly instead of 1.2).  
- Re-solve 2 questions where you were slow or wrong.

## Day 3 – Ratios & Proportions (Basics)

### 1. Concepts (20–30 min)
- Ratio: a : b, simplifying ratios.  
- Proportion: a/b = c/d.  
- Dividing a quantity in a given ratio:
  - Total parts = sum of ratio numbers.  
- Changing ratios to fractions and vice versa.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 questions**.

Problem types:
1. Simplify ratios  
   - 24 : 36, 150 : 225.
2. Divide amount in ratio  
   - “Divide Rs. 900 in ratio 2:3”  
   - “Divide 560 in ratio 3:5:4”.
3. Simple proportion  
   - “If 5 pens cost Rs. 60, what is cost of 8 pens?” (direct proportion)
4. Combining ratios  
   - A:B = 2:3, B:C = 4:5. Find A:B:C.

**Reinforces**
- Comfortable with ratio as “parts” of a whole.  
- Using proportion to scale quantities.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 3–4 ratio questions + 3–4 percent questions from earlier days.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Write simple notes:
  - “To divide in ratio m:n: total parts = m+n; share = (m/total)×amount.”

## Day 4 – Advanced Ratio Applications + Intro to Averages

### 1. Concepts (20–30 min)
- Word problems on ratios:
  - Ages, incomes, mixtures of two groups.  
- Basics of Average:
  - Average = total / number of items.  
- Relation between sum and average:
  - Sum = average × number of terms.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 questions**.

Problem types (ratios):
1. Age ratio problems  
   - “Ratio of ages of A and B is 3:5. Sum of ages is 40. Find their ages.”
2. Income ratio problems  
   - “A and B earn in ratio 4:7. If A earns Rs. 4000, find B’s income.”

Problem types (averages – basic):
1. Simple average  
   - “Average of 24, 28, 32, 36, 40.”  
2. Finding missing number from average  
   - “Average of 5 numbers is 20. Sum of four is 76. Find 5th number.”  
3. Average of first n natural numbers (optional, if comfortable)  
   - Use formula n(n+1)/2 / n = (n+1)/2.

**Reinforces**
- Combining ratios with totals.  
- Using average ↔ sum connection quickly.

## Day 5 – Averages: Effect of Adding/Removing; Weighted Average

### 1. Concepts (20–30 min)
- Adding/removing an item:
  - New sum or new average.  
- Weighted average:
  - When two groups combine (e.g., class A & class B).
- Shortcut patterns:
  - “If a new value equals the average, average remains same.”  
  - “If new value > average, average increases slightly.”

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 questions**.

Problem types:
1. Adding/removing elements  
   - “Average of 5 numbers is 30. One number 40 is removed. Find new average.”  
   - “Average of 10 numbers is 25. One more number is added and new average becomes 26. Find the new number.”
2. Two-group weighted average  
   - “Class A has 20 students with avg 60. Class B has 30 students with avg 70. Find combined average.”  
   - Use: total = sum1 + sum2 → avg = total / total students.
3. Average of consecutive integers  
   - “Average of 5 consecutive numbers is 17. Find the smallest number.”

**Reinforces**
- Thinking in totals (sum = avg × count).  
- Understanding how averages shift when new data is added.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- A blend (2 percentages + 3 ratios + 3 averages).

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Identify 1 type that feels slow (e.g., weighted avg).  
- Write a mini-template for it:
  - “Step 1: Compute total of group 1, Step 2: total of group 2, Step 3: divide by total count.”

2. Fractions + percentages  
   - “Simplify: (1/3 of 360) + 20% of 150 – 0.25 × 80.”

3. Mixed small equations  
   - Solve for x: “(3x + 5)/2 = 20”.

**Reinforces**
- Fast calculation while maintaining accuracy.  
- Comfort with mixing decimals, fractions, and percentages in one expression.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 8–10 questions pulling from:  
  - 3 % problems,  
  - 3 ratio problems,  
  - 2 averages,  
  - 2 simplifications.

Time yourself strictly; aim to finish 8–10 questions in 15 minutes.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Circle questions where **careless calculation** caused wrong answers.  
- Identify which operations (×, ÷, dealing with fractions) slow you down.

## Day 7 – Mini Mock + Full Revision

### 1. Timed Mini Mock (35–40 min)
Create/set a sectional test: **20–25 questions** only from Week 1 topics:
- 5–7 Percentages  
- 5–7 Ratios & Proportions  
- 5–7 Averages  
- 3–4 Simplifications

Use a single uninterrupted 35–40 min block:
- First pass: Quickly answer all easy ones.  
- Second pass: Attempt the medium ones you skipped.

### 2. Mock Review (30–40 min)
For each wrong or skipped question:
- Categorize:
  1. Didn’t know concept  
  2. Knew concept but misapplied  
  3. Silly error / speed issue
- Re-solve every such question **without looking** at solution first.

Make a short **Week 1 Formula Sheet**:
- % to fraction conversions.  
- Key ratio/average relationships.  
- Typical shortcuts learned (e.g., total = avg × n).

### 3. Light Reinforcement (Optional, 15–20 min)
- Do 5–10 random easy questions (any topic from the week) just to end the week on a confident note.
