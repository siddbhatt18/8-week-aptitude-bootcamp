Here is the detailed **Day-by-Day Plan for Week 1**. This week is the most critical because 50% of aptitude speed comes from the techniques learned here (Percentages).

### **Week 1: The Backbone (Percentages, Profit & Loss)**
**Goal:** Master the art of converting English sentences into Math equations and calculating without a calculator.

---

### **Day 1: The "Speed Math" Toolkit**
*Before solving logic problems, you must sharpen your tools.*

*   **Concept Focus:** Memorization and Fraction-Percentage equivalents.
*   **To Do:**
    1.  Memorize **Squares** up to 30 and **Cubes** up to 15.
    2.  **The Holy Grail of Speed:** Memorize Fraction-to-Percentage table (1/2 = 50% ... up to 1/20 = 5%).
        *   *Example:* You see $16.66\%$, your brain should immediately read it as $1/6$. You see $12.5\%$, read it as $1/8$.
*   **Practice Problem (Mental Math):**
    *   Calculate $14.28\%$ of 490 without multiplying.
    *   *Solution:* $14.28\%$ is $1/7$. So, $490 / 7 = 70$. Done in 2 seconds.

### **Day 2: Basic Percentage Rules**
*Focus: Understanding "Base" – The most common mistake beginners make.*

*   **Concept Focus:**
    1.  **A% of B = B% of A** (Calculating 64% of 25 is hard; 25% of 64 is easy $\to$ 16).
    2.  **The "Than" Rule:** If the question asks "A is what % *more than* B?", B is the denominator.
*   **Problem (Beginner):**
    *   "If A's income is Rs. 100 and B's income is Rs. 125. By what percent is B's income more than A's?"
    *   *Concept:* $\frac{Difference}{Reference (A)} \times 100$.
*   **Problem (Intermediate):**
    *   "If X is 20% less than Y, by what percent is Y more than X?"
    *   *Technique:* Assume Y = 100. Then X = 80. Difference = 20. Base is now X. $\frac{20}{80} = \frac{1}{4} = 25\%$.

### **Day 3: Percentage Change & Successive Change**
*Focus: The "AB" Formula and Population/Salary problems.*

*   **Concept Focus:**
    1.  **Multiplier Method:** 20% increase means multiply by 1.2. 20% decrease means multiply by 0.8.
    2.  **Successive Formula:** Net Change = $A + B + \frac{AB}{100}$ (Use signs: + for increase, - for decrease).
*   **Problem (Placement Favorite):**
    *   "The price of a book is increased by 20% and then decreased by 10%. What is the net percentage change in price?"
    *   *Solution:* $20 + (-10) + \frac{20 \times -10}{100} = 10 - 2 = +8\%$ increase.
*   **Problem (Geometry Application):**
    *   "If the length of a rectangle is increased by 30% and breadth decreased by 20%, find the % change in area."
    *   *Hint:* Use the same AB formula.

### **Day 4: The "Product Constancy" Rule**
*Focus: Problems where Expenditure or Revenue remains constant.*

*   **Concept Focus:** Price $\times$ Consumption = Expenditure. If Price goes UP, Consumption must go DOWN to keep Expenditure constant.
*   **Shortcut:** If Price increases by $\frac{1}{x}$, Consumption decreases by $\frac{1}{x+1}$.
*   **Problem (Intermediate/PYQ):**
    *   "The price of sugar increases by 25%. By what percentage should a family reduce its consumption so that their expenditure remains the same?"
    *   *Logic:* $25\% = 1/4$ increase. Consumption must decrease by $\frac{1}{4+1} = 1/5 = 20\%$.

### **Day 5: Profit & Loss Basics**
*Focus: Moving from Percentages to Money.*

*   **Concept Focus:**
    1.  **Profit/Loss is ALWAYS calculated on Cost Price (CP)** unless specified.
    2.  **SP = CP $\times$ Multiplier.** (If 20% profit, $SP = 1.2 \times CP$).
*   **Problem (Beginner):**
    *   "A man bought a cycle for Rs. 500 and sold it for Rs. 600. Find Profit %."
*   **Problem (Tricky - PYQ):**
    *   "By selling a watch for Rs. 1440, a man loses 10%. At what price should he sell it to gain 10%?"
    *   *Solution:* 1440 is 90% of CP. We need 110% of CP.
    *   Calculation: $\frac{1440}{0.9} \times 1.1 = 1760$.

### **Day 6: Discount, Markup & The "Dishonest Dealer"**
*Focus: Advanced concepts that appear in higher-tier exams (Amazon/Deloitte).*

*   **Concept Focus:**
    1.  **Cost Price $\to$ (Markup) $\to$ Marked Price $\to$ (Discount) $\to$ Selling Price.**
    2.  **Dishonest Dealer:** Uses false weight. Profit% = $\frac{Error}{True Value - Error} \times 100$.
*   **Problem (Market Price Logic):**
    *   "A shopkeeper marks his goods 50% above CP and allows a discount of 20%. What is his actual profit percentage?"
    *   *Method:* Use AB formula: $50 - 20 - \frac{50 \times 20}{100} = 30 - 10 = 20\%$.
*   **Problem (Dishonest Dealer):**
    *   "A dealer professes to sell at Cost Price but uses a 900gm weight for a 1kg weight. Find his profit %."
    *   *Logic:* He saves 100gm while giving 900gm. Profit = $\frac{100}{900} = \frac{1}{9} = 11.11\%$.

### **Day 7: Weekly Review & Mini-Mock**
*Focus: Speed and Accuracy check.*

1.  **Revise:** Recite the Fraction-to-% table and the AB formula.
2.  **Solve:** Pick 10 random questions from a website like IndiaBix or GeeksforGeeks under "Profit and Loss".
3.  **Self-Correction:**
    *   Did you calculate Profit on SP by mistake? (Remember, always CP).
    *   Did you mistake "by 20%" for "to 20%"?
