## Block 0 – Quick Recap of Days 1–2 (10–15 minutes)

This is just to keep number sense fresh.

1. Open your notebook:
   - Skim through:
     - Divisibility rules (2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11).  
     - Prime factorization, LCM, HCF basics.

2. On rough paper, without looking:
   - Write divisibility rules for 4, 6, 8, 11 in 2–3 lines.
   - Factorize **36** and **45** into primes.

3. Self-check:
   - Correct any mistakes from your notes.
   - If you still mix 4 and 8 or 3 and 9 or 11-rule, note again in **Mistakes & Doubts**.

Then move to today’s topic.

## Block 1 – Concept: What is Percentage? (15–20 minutes)

Create a new heading in **Concepts**: “Percentages – Basics”.

### 1.1 Meaning of Percentage

Write in your own words:

- “Percent” means **per hundred**.  
  - 25% means 25 out of 100 = 25/100  
  - 50% means 50 out of 100 = 50/100  
  - 10% means 10 out of 100 = 10/100

Examples to write:

- Out of 100 students, if 40 are girls, then 40% of the class are girls.  
- If a shirt originally priced at ₹100 is given a 20% discount, the discount is ₹20.

### 1.2 Basic Conversions: % ↔ Fraction ↔ Decimal

Write the **general rules**:

- From % to **fraction**:  
  x% = x/100 (simplify fraction if possible).
- From % to **decimal**:  
  Move decimal point **two places left**.  
  - 25% → 0.25  
  - 4% → 0.04  
  - 12.5% → 0.125
- From decimal to %:  
  Move decimal point **two places right** and write %.
  - 0.5 → 50%  
  - 0.25 → 25%  
  - 0.075 → 7.5%

Write a small table in your notebook:

| Percentage | Fraction  | Decimal  |
|-----------:|-----------|----------|
| 10%        | 1/10      | 0.10     |
| 25%        | 1/4       | 0.25     |
| 50%        | 1/2       | 0.50     |
| 75%        | 3/4       | 0.75     |
| 20%        | 1/5       | 0.20     |
| 40%        | 2/5       | 0.40     |

You’ll expand this in the next block.

## Block 2 – Key Fraction–Percentage–Decimal Table (25–30 minutes)

These values are extremely common in exams. You want them to be *instant*.

### 2.1 Learn the Standard Conversions (15–20 min)

In **Concepts**, create a big three-column list and fill it:

1. **1/2 family**
- 1/2 = 0.5 = **50%**

2. **1/3 and 2/3**
- 1/3 ≈ 0.3333… = **33⅓%**  
- 2/3 ≈ 0.6666… = **66⅔%**

3. **1/4 family**
- 1/4 = 0.25 = **25%**  
- 3/4 = 0.75 = **75%**

4. **1/5 family**
- 1/5 = 0.2 = **20%**  
- 2/5 = 0.4 = **40%**  
- 3/5 = 0.6 = **60%**  
- 4/5 = 0.8 = **80%**

5. **1/8 family**
- 1/8 = 0.125 = **12.5%**  
- 3/8 = 0.375 = **37.5%**  
- 5/8 = 0.625 = **62.5%**  
- 7/8 = 0.875 = **87.5%**

6. **1/10 and 1/20**
- 1/10 = 0.1 = **10%**  
- 1/20 = 0.05 = **5%**

7. (Optional but useful) **1/6 and 1/12**
- 1/6 ≈ 0.1666… ≈ **16⅔%**  
- 1/12 ≈ 0.0833… ≈ **8⅓%**

You don’t need to perfectly memorize all in one day, but start with:

- 1/2, 1/3, 2/3  
- 1/4, 3/4  
- 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5  
- 1/8, 3/8  
- 1/10, 1/20

### 2.2 Self-test the Table (10 minutes)

On a fresh page, without looking at your table:

1. Convert to % (approximate where needed):
   - 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, 1/5, 3/5, 1/8, 3/8, 1/10, 1/20

2. Convert to fractions:
   - 25%, 40%, 60%, 12.5%, 33⅓%, 50%, 75%, 10%

Check with your notes and circle the ones you got wrong or took too long on. These are the ones to revise again at the end of the day.

---

## Block 3 – Operations with Percentages (35–40 minutes)

Now apply the understanding to actual numeric problems.

Create a heading **“Operations with %”** in your notebook.

### 3.1 “x% of a number” – Direct Calculation (15–20 min)

Concept:

- x% of N = (x/100) × N  
- Shortcut mindset:
  - 10% of N = N/10  
  - 1% of N = N/100  
  - 5% of N = (10% of N)/2  
  - 20% of N = 2 × (10% of N)  
  - 25% of N = N/4  
  - 50% of N = N/2  
  - 75% of N = 3N/4  
  - 33⅓% of N ≈ N/3

**Practice A – Using Basic Definitions**

Solve and write working:

1. Find:
   - (a) 20% of 450  
   - (b) 10% of 760  
   - (c) 5% of 980  
   - (d) 25% of 320  
   - (e) 12.5% of 640  

2. Use mental shortcuts where you can:
   - 20% of 450 = 2 × (10% of 450)  
   - 10% of 450 = 45 → so 20% = 90

**Practice B – Slightly Higher Numbers**

3. Find:
   - (a) 33⅓% of 270  
   - (b) 40% of 850  
   - (c) 75% of 480  
   - (d) 60% of 1,250  

Try first without calculator, using fraction equivalents (like 1/3, 3/4, 3/5, etc.).

---

### 3.2 Reverse %: Given Part → Find Total (15–20 min)

Concept:

- If x% of N = A, then  
  N = A × (100/x)

Examples to write:

1. “40% of a number is 120. Find the number.”

   - 40% of N = 120  
   - N = 120 × (100/40) = 120 × (10/4) = 120 × (5/2) = 120 × 2.5 = 300

2. “25% of a quantity is 45. Find 100% of the quantity (the full quantity).”

   - 25% = 45  
   - 1% = 45/25  
   - 100% = 45 × (100/25) = 45 × 4 = 180

**Practice C – Reverse Percent Problems**

Solve:

1. 30% of a number is 150. Find the number.  
2. 12.5% of a number is 25. Find the number.  
3. A student scored 80 marks which is 40% of the total marks. Find total marks.  
4. A number decreased to 84, which is 70% of the original. What was the original number?  
   - Hint: 70% of original = 84 → original = 84 × (100/70).

Write the full solutions step by step.

Mark any question where you set up the equation incorrectly in **Mistakes & Doubts**.

---

## Block 4 – Mixed Basic Problems (Concept Reinforcement) (25–30 minutes)

Now mix conversions and operations.

### 4.1 Straightforward Questions (10–15 min)

1. Convert to decimal and then find:
   - (a) 15% of 200  
   - (b) 2.5% of 800  
   - (c) 7.5% of 320  

   Examples:
   - 15% = 0.15 → 0.15 × 200 = 30  
   - 2.5% = 0.025

2. If 60% of a quantity is 90, what is:
   - (a) 20% of the same quantity?  
   - (b) 80% of the same quantity?

   Hint: First find total quantity, then other percentages.

3. A student scored 35% in a test of 200 marks.  
   - (a) How many marks did the student score?  
   - (b) How many more marks are needed to reach 50%?

---

### 4.2 Slightly Conceptual (10–15 min)

4. “40% of a number is 24. What is 60% of the same number?”

   - Notice: You don’t need full number if you think smartly.  
   - If 40% = 24 → 10% = 6 → 60% = 6 × 6 = 36.

5. “A quantity is first increased by 10%, then decreased by 10%. If original quantity is 100, what is the final value?”  
   - Compute step-by-step:
     - After 10% increase: 100 → 110  
     - After 10% decrease: 110 → 110 − 11 = 99  
   - Understand that net effect is **not** 0.

6. “In a class, 25% of students are absent. If 30 students are present, how many students are in the class total?”  
   - Present = 75% = 30 → total = 30 × (100/75).

Write all reasoning clearly.

## Block 5 – Speed Drill: Mental Percentage Practice (10–15 minutes)

**Aim:** Get faster at “% of number” mentally.

1. Prepare a list of about **10–12 base numbers** (write them down):  
   80, 120, 200, 240, 300, 360, 480, 600, 720, 800, 960, 1,000

2. Set a **timer for 10–12 minutes**.

3. For each base number, mentally compute the following percentages and write just the answers:

   - 10% of N  
   - 20% of N  
   - 25% of N  
   - 33⅓% of N  
   - 50% of N  

Example: for N = 120:

- 10% → 12  
- 20% → 24  
- 25% → 30  
- 33⅓% → 40  
- 50% → 60  

4. Try to do them mostly in your head; write intermediate steps only if you must.

5. After time is up:
   - Check a few calculations with a calculator or by hand.  
   - Note which % you were slow at (commonly 33⅓% and 12.5%).  
   - Write them under **Mistakes & Doubts** to revise tomorrow.

---

## Block 6 – Reflection & Summary (10–15 minutes)

### 6.1 Day 3 Summary Notes (5–10 min)

In your **Summary Day 3** section, write:

1. Meaning of percentage in 1–2 lines.  
2. General rules:
   - % → decimal: move decimal 2 places left.  
   - Decimal → %: 2 places right.  
   - x% of N = (x/100) × N.  
   - If x% of N = A → N = A × 100/x.  

3. Your mini fraction–% table (at least):

   - 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4  
   - 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5  
   - 1/8, 3/8  
   - 1/10, 1/20

Circle 3–5 that you still hesitate on.

### 6.2 Mark Weak Spots for Day 4 (5 min)

From **Mistakes & Doubts**:

- Are you more uncomfortable with:
  - Conversions (fractions ↔ %)?  
  - “x% of N” calculations?  
  - Reverse % (“x% of N = A, find N”)?

These weak points will be revised for **10–15 minutes at the start of Day 4**, before learning percentage increase/decrease and net change.

---

## Optional Extra Practice (If You Have Time/Energy)

If you have 20–30 minutes left:

- Visit IndiaBix / PrepInsta → Quantitative Aptitude → Percentages (Basics).  
- Do:
  - 5–10 conversion questions (fractions ↔ %).  
  - 5–10 “x% of a number” and “find the number from %” questions.

Any question that:
- You found tricky, or  
- Used a neat shortcut you liked,  

copy it with full solution into your **Examples** section for later revision.

---

If you tell me which part of percentages (conversions vs “% of number” vs reverse problems) felt hardest after doing Day 3, I can tune Day 4 to include extra targeted drills before we move on to percentage increase/decrease.
