Day 3 introduces **Ratios & Proportion (basics)**. This is a core building block for many aptitude topics: mixtures, profit sharing, averages, DI, and even some time–work/time–speed questions.

Target time: **2.5–3 hours**  
Flow: **Quick warm‑up (Day 1–2) → Learn concepts → Guided examples → Practice (increasing difficulty) → Speed drill → Reflection.**

---

## Quick Warm‑up (10–15 min)

Before starting ratios, quickly refresh 3–5 questions from earlier days (no detailed working, just answers):

1. 25% of 640 = ?  
2. A value increases from 200 to 260. % increase?  
3. A number after 20% increase becomes 360. Find original.  
4. 3/5 as percentage?  
5. After +10% and then −10%, net % change?

Check mentally; if 2–3 of these feel slow, note them for later revision, but move on to today’s main topic.

## Core Objectives for Day 3 (Ratios & Proportion Basics)

By the end of today, you should be able to:

1. Understand **what a ratio means** and how to **simplify** it.
2. Quickly **divide a quantity in a given ratio**.
3. Convert between **ratio and fraction/percentage** where useful.
4. Handle basic **equivalent ratios & proportionality** problems.

---

## Block 1 (25–30 min): Concepts & Notes

Open a fresh page titled **“Ratios – Day 3”**.

### 1. What is a ratio?

- A ratio compares two (or more) quantities:  
  - `a : b` means “a to b” and equals `a / b`.
- Order matters:
  - 2:3 is not the same as 3:2.

Write examples:

- Boys : Girls = 3 : 2  
- If boys = 30 and girls = 20 → total = 50, ratio = 30:20 = 3:2.

### 2. Simplifying a ratio

- To simplify a:b, divide both by their **GCD (HCF)**:
  - 24:32 → divide by 8 → 3:4  
  - 45:60 → divide by 15 → 3:4

Include non‑integer types:

- 0.6 : 0.9 → (6/10) : (9/10) → 6:9 → 2:3  
- (1/2) : (3/4) → multiply both by 4: (2 : 3)

### 3. Scaling a ratio (equivalent ratios)

- If a:b = 2:3, multiplying/dividing both by same number gives equivalent ratios:
  - 2:3 = 4:6 = 6:9 = 10:15.

Use this to match totals in word problems.

### 4. Dividing a quantity in a given ratio

If total = S and ratio = a:b:

- Sum of parts = a + b  
- A’s share = `S × a / (a + b)`  
- B’s share = `S × b / (a + b)`

For 3 parts a:b:c:

- Sum = a + b + c  
- Each share = `S × (individual part / total parts)`

Write one example in your notes:

> Divide 600 in ratio 2:3.  
> Sum = 2 + 3 = 5.  
> A = 600 × 2/5 = 240; B = 600 × 3/5 = 360.

### 5. Ratio vs percentage intuition

- If A:B = 3:2, total parts = 5:
  - A = 3/5 of total → 60% of total  
  - B = 2/5 of total → 40% of total.

This will be useful later in DI and averages.

---

## Block 2 (15–20 min): Guided Examples (Step-by-Step)

Do these neatly. They define the patterns you’ll see repeatedly.

### Example 1 – Simplifying a simple ratio

Simplify 36:48.

- GCD(36, 48) = 12  
- 36 ÷ 12 = 3, 48 ÷ 12 = 4  
- Simplified ratio = **3:4**

---

### Example 2 – Simplifying with decimals

Simplify 0.75 : 1.25.

- Write as fractions: 0.75 = 75/100, 1.25 = 125/100  
- Ratio = 75/100 : 125/100 = 75:125  
- Divide by 25 → 3:5  

**Answer:** 3 : 5

---

### Example 3 – Fractions in ratio

Simplify (1/3) : (5/6).

- Multiply both by LCM of denominators (here 6)  
- (1/3)×6 : (5/6)×6 = 2 : 5  

**Answer:** 2 : 5

---

### Example 4 – Divide a quantity in a ratio

Divide ₹900 between A and B in ratio 4:5.

- Sum of parts = 4 + 5 = 9  
- A = 900 × 4/9 = 400  
- B = 900 × 5/9 = 500  

**Check:** 400 + 500 = 900.

---

### Example 5 – 3‑part division

Divide 1,200 in ratio 2:3:5.

- Sum = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10  
- Each part = 1,200/10 = 120  
- Shares:  
  - First = 2 × 120 = 240  
  - Second = 3 × 120 = 360  
  - Third = 5 × 120 = 600  

**Check:** 240 + 360 + 600 = 1,200.

---

### Example 6 – From % to ratio

A’s salary is 20% more than B’s. Find ratio A:B.

- Let B = 100, then A = 120  
- Ratio A:B = 120:100 = 6:5  

**Answer:** 6 : 5

This pattern (assume base 100) is very useful and quick.

## Block 4 (15–20 min): Speed Drill – Ratio Simplification & Quick Splits

Here you focus on **speed** and **pattern recognition**, not long reasoning.

### Drill 1 – Rapid Simplification

Time yourself for **8–10 minutes**. Simplify all without detailed writing if possible:

1. 18 : 27  
2. 42 : 56  
3. 96 : 120  
4. 63 : 105  
5. 2.4 : 0.6  
6. 7.5 : 12.5  
7. (5/6) : (10/9)  
8. (7/8) : (21/16)

Check how many you can do accurately and quickly.

### Drill 2 – Quick Division by Ratio

Time: **8–10 minutes**. Aim to solve fast and neatly:

9. Divide 1,000 in ratio 1 : 4.  
10. Divide 900 in ratio 3 : 2.  
11. Divide 750 in ratio 2 : 3 : 5.  
12. Total marks 600 are shared by A, B, C in ratio 5 : 3 : 2. How many marks does B get?  

Try to avoid full-blown equations; rely on ratio sums and “each part = total/parts”.

---

## Block 5 (10–15 min): Error Review & Reflection

Create a **“Day 3 Summary”** page.

1. Go through all practice questions:
   - Mark incorrect ones with a cross (✗).  
   - Mark those that felt slow (took >3 min) with a dot (•).

2. For each marked question, write:
   - Type: “Simplify”, “Divide total”, or “Find numbers from sum/diff”.  
   - Why it was hard:  
     - GCD not obvious?  
     - Setting up equation from ratio?  
     - Arithmetic?

3. Write 3 quick takeaways:
   - “I can now quickly divide in ratio when total is known.”  
   - “Need more practice simplifying decimals in ratios.”  
   - “Sum/difference problems with ratio are still slow.”

These notes will help you choose targeted warm‑ups for **Day 4**.

## Answer Key (Check Only After Attempt)

### Part A – Simplifying Ratios

1. 24 : 40 → divide by 8 → **3 : 5**  
2. 63 : 81 → divide by 9 → **7 : 9**  
3. 150 : 210 → divide by 30 → **5 : 7**  
4. 0.8 : 1.2 = 8/10 : 12/10 = 8:12 → divide by 4 → **2 : 3**  
5. 2.5 : 7.5 = 25/10 : 75/10 = 25:75 → divide by 25 → **1 : 3**  
6. (3/5) : (9/10) → multiply by 10 → 6 : 9 → divide by 3 → **2 : 3**  
7. (4/9) : (2/3) → multiply by 9 → 4 : 6 → divide by 2 → **2 : 3**

---

### Part B – Dividing Quantities

8. 600, ratio 2 : 3 → sum = 5  
   - A = 600×2/5 = **240**  
   - B = 600×3/5 = **360**

9. 840, ratio 1 : 2 : 3 → sum = 6 → each part = 840/6 = 140  
   - X = 1×140 = 140  
   - Y = 2×140 = 280  
   - Z = 3×140 = 420

10. 1,500, ratio 7 : 8 → sum = 15  
    - A = 1,500×7/15 = 700  
    - B = 1,500×8/15 = 800  

11. Boys : Girls = 5 : 3; Girls = 200  
    - 3 parts = 200 → 1 part = 200/3 ≈ 66.67 (but we expect an integer)  
    Better: Assume total = 5k + 3k = 8k, girls = 3k = 200 → k = 200/3 (not integer).  
    So interpret differently:  
    Let Boys = 5x, Girls = 3x. If Girls = 200 → 3x = 200 → x = 200/3.  
    This does not give an integer; in real exam, they usually give nicer numbers.  
    To fix, let’s *reinterpret* question as:  
    “If there are 200 students in total and ratio is 5 : 3” (more standard). Then:  
    - Sum parts = 8 → each part = 200/8 = 25  
    - Boys = 5×25 = 125, Girls = 3×25 = 75  

    If *your* question set had an integer answer scenario, it would likely be this version. You can note both patterns.

12. Profit = 32,000; ratio 3 : 5 → sum = 8  
    - Partner 1 = 32,000×3/8 = **12,000**  
    - Partner 2 = 32,000×5/8 = **20,000**

---

### Part C – Ratio Relationships

13. A:B = 3 : 5, A = 18 → 3 parts = 18 → 1 part = 6 → B = 5×6 = **30**  

14. a:b = 4:7, sum = 165 → 4x + 7x = 165 → 11x = 165 → x = 15  
    - Numbers = 4×15 = **60**, 7×15 = **105**

15. a:b = 5:8, difference = 39 → 8x – 5x = 39 → 3x = 39 → x = 13  
    - Numbers = 5×13 = **65**, 8×13 = **104**

16. Red:Blue = 2:5, Red = 14 → 2 parts = 14 → 1 part = 7 → Blue = 5×7 = **35**

17. Boys:Girls = 7:4, total = 33 → 7x + 4x = 33 → 11x = 33 → x = 3  
    - Boys = 7×3 = **21**  
    - Girls = 4×3 = **12**

---

### Part D – Advanced / Mixed

18. Profit split 4 : 3; A’s share is 3,200 more than B.  

Let A = 4x, B = 3x. Then 4x – 3x = x = 3,200 → x = 3,200  
Total profit = 4x + 3x = 7x = 7×3,200 = **22,400**

19. A:B = 3:4; after +5,000 each → new ratio 4:5.  

Let original A = 3x, B = 4x.  
New A = 3x + 5,000; New B = 4x + 5,000.  

Given: (3x + 5,000)/(4x + 5,000) = 4/5  
Cross‑multiply: 5(3x + 5,000) = 4(4x + 5,000)  
15x + 25,000 = 16x + 20,000 → x = 5,000  

Original A = 3×5,000 = **15,000**  
Original B = 4×5,000 = **20,000**

20. Managers:Engineers:Technicians = 2 : 5 : 7  
Technicians = 7 parts = 140 → 1 part = 20  
Managers = 2×20 = 40  
Engineers = 5×20 = 100  
Total employees = 40 + 100 + 140 = **280**

21. Milk:Water = 3 : 1, Milk = 12 L  
3 parts = 12 → 1 part = 4  
Water = 1×4 = **4 L**  
Total mixture = 12 + 4 = **16 L**

22. Numbers in ratio 2:3 → let them be 2x and 3x.  
After adding 6: (2x + 6) : (3x + 6) = 3 : 4  

(2x + 6)/(3x + 6) = 3/4  
Cross‑multiplying: 4(2x + 6) = 3(3x + 6)  
8x + 24 = 9x + 18 → x = 6  

Numbers = 2×6 = **12**, 3×6 = **18**
