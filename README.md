This study plan is built on the **Pareto Principle (80-20 Rule)**: 80% of the questions in Online Assessments (OAs) typically come from just 20% of the syllabus.

Most placement exams (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, Startup OAs) prioritize **Arithmetic and Data Interpretation** over pure math (like Geometry or Trigonometry). This plan focuses entirely on that high-yield "Core 20%."

### **The Strategy**

* **Focus:** Arithmetic (Quant), Arrangements (Logical), and Error Spotting (Verbal).
* **Routine:** 1.5 - 2 hours daily.
* **Method:** Learn the concept \rightarrow Solve 15 Beginner questions \rightarrow Solve 10 Advanced PYQ-style questions.

---

### **Phase 1: The Quantitative Backbone (Weeks 1–3)**

*Goal: Master Arithmetic. If you are good at this, you pass the cut-off.*

#### **Week 1: The "Unitary Method" Family**

**Topics:** Percentages, Ratio & Proportions, Profit & Loss.

* **Why:** These three topics form the basis for Data Interpretation and advanced Quant.

| Level | Problem Type | Description & Key Concepts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Beginner** | **Direct Calculation** | *Concept:* Basic conversion (Fraction to %). <br>

<br> *Example:* "What is 20% of 150?" or "Convert 3:5 to a percentage." |
| **Intermediate** | **The "Consumption" Change** | *Concept:* Inverse relationship. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "Price of sugar increases by 20%. By what % must consumption decrease to keep expenditure constant?" |
| **Advanced** | **Dishonest Dealer** | *Concept:* Profit margin manipulation. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "A dealer uses a 900g weight instead of 1kg and marks up goods by 10%. Find his net profit %." |

#### **Week 2: Rate of Change**

**Topics:** Time & Work, Pipes & Cisterns.

* **Why:** Highly predictable. There is almost always 1-2 questions on this in every set.

| Level | Problem Type | Description & Key Concepts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Beginner** | **Simple Efficiency** | *Concept:* Work = Efficiency × Time. <br>

<br> *Example:* "A does work in 10 days, B in 15. How long do they take together?" |
| **Intermediate** | **Leaving the Job** | *Concept:* Remaining Work. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "A and B start together. After 3 days, A leaves. How long does B take to finish the remaining work?" |
| **Advanced** | **Alternate Days** | *Concept:* Cyclic Work. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "A and B work on alternate days starting with A. If A takes 10 days and B takes 12, when will work finish?" |

#### **Week 3: Motion & Numbers**

**Topics:** Time Speed Distance (TSD), Trains, Basic Number System (Divisibility/LCM).

| Level | Problem Type | Description & Key Concepts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Beginner** | **Unit Conversion** | *Concept:* km/hr to m/s conversion. <br>

<br> *Example:* "Convert 72 km/hr to m/s and find time to cross a pole." |
| **Intermediate** | **Relative Speed** | *Concept:* S_{rel} = S_1 + S_2 (Opposite) or S_1 - S_2 (Same). <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "Two trains running in opposite directions cross each other in 12s. Find the length of the slower train." |
| **Advanced** | **Late/Early Concept** | *Concept:* Constant Distance (S \propto 1/T). <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "Walking at 4 km/hr, I reach school 5 mins late. At 5 km/hr, I reach 10 mins early. Find the distance." |

---

### **Phase 2: Logic & Critical Thinking (Weeks 4–5)**

*Goal: Speed. Logical reasoning is usually easy but time-consuming. You need to do these fast.*

#### **Week 4: Visual & Pattern Logic**

**Topics:** Coding-Decoding, Number Series, Blood Relations.

| Level | Problem Type | Description & Key Concepts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Beginner** | **Direct Substitution** | *Concept:* Position of letters (A=1, B=2...). <br>

<br> *Example:* "If CAT = 24, what is DOG?" |
| **Intermediate** | **Pattern Series** | *Concept:* Dual series or geometric progression. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "Find the wrong number: 3, 7, 15, 30, 63." (Logic: \times 2 + 1; 30 is wrong). |
| **Advanced** | **Coded Blood Relations** | *Concept:* Substitution logic. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "If 'A+B' means A is father of B... then how is P related to Q in 'P+R-Q'?" |

#### **Week 5: Arrangements & Syllogisms**

**Topics:** Seating Arrangement (Linear/Circular), Syllogism (Venn Diagrams).

| Level | Problem Type | Description & Key Concepts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Beginner** | **Linear Row** | *Concept:* Left vs. Right orientation. <br>

<br> *Example:* "5 people sit in a row. A is left of B..." |
| **Intermediate** | **Circular In/Out** | *Concept:* Facing Center vs. Facing Away (Left/Right reverses). <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "8 friends sit at a circular table, some facing center, some facing out." |
| **Advanced** | **Possibility Case** | *Concept:* "Can be" vs "Is". <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* Syllogisms where the conclusion uses "Some A being B is a possibility." |

---

### **Phase 3: Verbal & Integrated Skills (Weeks 6–7)**

*Goal: Accuracy. Most students lose marks here due to guessing.*

#### **Week 6: Verbal High-Yields**

**Topics:** Subject-Verb Agreement, Error Spotting, Reading Comprehension (RC).

| Level | Problem Type | Description & Key Concepts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Beginner** | **Tense Check** | *Concept:* Singular Subject = Singular Verb. <br>

<br> *Example:* "The list of items *are* on the desk." (Error: list *is*) |
| **Intermediate** | **Para-Jumbles** | *Concept:* Finding the "Opening Sentence" and mandatory pairs. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "Arrange sentences P, Q, R, S to form a coherent paragraph." |
| **Advanced** | **Inference RC** | *Concept:* Reading between the lines. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "What does the author imply by the phrase 'iron velvet' in the second paragraph?" |

#### **Week 7: Data Interpretation (DI) & Combinatorics**

**Topics:** Charts (Bar/Pie), Permutation & Combination (Basics).

| Level | Problem Type | Description & Key Concepts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Beginner** | **Visual Estimation** | *Concept:* Reading graphs without calculation. <br>

| **Intermediate** | **Double Pie Chart** | *Concept:* Ratio between two totals. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "Pie Chart 1 shows Total students; Chart 2 shows Girls. Find the number of Boys in Dept A." |
| **Advanced** | **Selection Logic** | *Concept:* {}^nC_r. <br>

<br> *PYQ Style:* "A committee of 5 is to be formed from 6 men and 4 women such that at least 2 women are included." |

---

### **Phase 4: Execution (Week 8)**

*Goal: Stamina and Skipping Strategy.*

#### **Week 8: Mock Marathon**

* **Day 1-2:** Take **Sectional Tests** (20 mins Quant, 20 mins Logic). Focus on *accuracy*, not speed.
* **Day 3-5:** Take **Full-Length Mock Tests** (60-90 mins).
* **Strategy:** Apply the "Round Concept".
* *Round 1:* Solve all easy questions (Direct Formula/Logic). Skip anything that takes >1 min.
* *Round 2:* Come back to the "Marked for Review" questions.




* **Day 6:** Analyze your errors. Did you make a calculation mistake (silly) or a conceptual mistake (serious)?
* **Day 7:** Rest and light formula revision.

### **Next Step**

Would you like me to generate a **diagnostic test** with 5 questions (one from each key area) to assess your current beginner level?
