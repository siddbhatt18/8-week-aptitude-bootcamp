This is a strategic, 8-week study plan designed using the **80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**. We will focus on the **20% of topics that appear in ~80% of placement online assessments** (e.g., TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, AMCAT, CoCubes).

### **The Strategy: Speed & Pattern Recognition**
* **Goal:** To clear the "cutoff" (usually 60-70% accuracy) with high speed.
* **Core 20% Topics:** Arithmetic (Percentage, Ratios), Time & Motion, Basic Number Systems, and Logical Patterns.
* **Daily Routine:** 1 hour learning concepts + 1 hour practicing problems.

### **Phase 1: The Arithmetic Backbone (Weeks 1-2)**
*Why this first?* These four topics are the "alphabet" of aptitude. If you master these, you can solve Data Interpretation, Mixtures, and Profit/Loss problems instinctively without formulas.

#### **Week 1: Percentages & Ratios**
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Percentage-to-Fraction conversion:** (e.g., $16.66\% = 1/6$, $12.5\% = 1/8$). Memorize these up to $1/20$.
    * **Multipliers:** Increasing a number by 20% means multiplying by $1.2$.
    * **Ratio Balancing:** Combining $A:B$ and $B:C$ into $A:B:C$.

| Difficulty | Problem Type (PYQ Style) | Key Concept Refined |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beginner** | If A's salary is 20% more than B's, by what % is B's salary less than A's? | Base change rule ($1/5$ increase $\to$ $1/6$ decrease). |
| **Intermediate** | In an election between two candidates, 10% voters didn't vote. The winner got 54% of *casted* votes and won by 1620 votes. Find the total voter list. | Successive percentage changes. |
| **Advanced** | Fresh grapes contain 80% water; dry grapes contain 10% water. How many kg of dry grapes can be obtained from 20 kg of fresh grapes? | Equating the "constant" part (pulp) rather than the variable part (water). |

#### **Week 2: Averages, Mixtures & Profit/Loss**
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Weighted Average:** Use the "See-Saw" method (Alligation) to solve mixture problems instantly.
    * **Profit/Loss:** Calculate everything on Cost Price (CP) unless specified.
    * **Dishonest Dealer:** Concept of using false weights (e.g., 900g instead of 1kg).

| Difficulty | Problem Type (PYQ Style) | Key Concept Refined |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beginner** | The average age of 10 students is 15. If the teacher's age is added, the average increases by 1. Find the teacher's age. | Deviation method (Observation vs Calculation). |
| **Intermediate** | A milkman mixes water with milk to gain 25% profit by selling at Cost Price. What is the ratio of water to milk? | Relationship between profit % and mixture ratio when SP = CP. |
| **Advanced** | A trader sells two items at ₹9900 each. One at 10% profit, other at 10% loss. Find overall gain/loss %. | Net effect formula: $x^2/100$ loss. |

### **Phase 2: Efficiency & Motion (Weeks 3-4)**
*Why this?* Time & Work and TSD (Time, Speed, Distance) are high-frequency topics in engineering placements (especially TCS & Infosys).

#### **Week 3: Time & Work (Chain Rule & Pipes)**
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **LCM Method:** Assume total work = LCM of days (avoid fractions like $1/x$).
    * **Efficiency:** Efficiency is inversely proportional to Time. ($A$ is twice as good $\to$ $A$ takes half the time).
    * **Man-Days:** $M_1 D_1 H_1 / W_1 = M_2 D_2 H_2 / W_2$.

| Difficulty | Problem Type (PYQ Style) | Key Concept Refined |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beginner** | A does work in 10 days, B in 15 days. How many days if they work together? | Basic LCM efficiency method. |
| **Intermediate** | A and B start work. A leaves 2 days before completion. The work finishes in 8 days. How long would A alone take? | Backward calculation or "forcing" A to stay concept. |
| **Advanced** | 3 men or 6 women can do a job in 16 days. In how many days can 12 men and 8 women do it? | "And/Or" relationship conversion. |

#### **Week 4: Time, Speed, Distance (Trains & Boats)**
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Relative Speed:** Same direction $\to$ Subtract speeds. Opposite direction $\to$ Add speeds.
    * **Unit Conversion:** km/hr to m/s $\to$ Multiply by $5/18$.
    * **Trains:** Length of train is always added to length of platform/bridge.

| Difficulty | Problem Type (PYQ Style) | Key Concept Refined |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beginner** | A train 100m long crosses a pole in 10s. Find speed in km/hr. | Basic distance/time + Unit conversion. |
| **Intermediate** | A thief is spotted by a policeman from 200m. Thief runs at 10kmph, police at 12kmph. How far will the thief run before being caught? | Relative speed catching time. |
| **Advanced** | Two trains start from A and B towards each other. After crossing, they take 4 hours and 9 hours to reach their destinations. Find speed ratio. | Special Property: Ratio of speeds = $\sqrt{T_2} : \sqrt{T_1}$. |

### **Phase 3: Logic & Numbers (Weeks 5-6)**
*Why this?* Number system questions (divisibility, remainders) are trick questions used to filter candidates. Logical reasoning (coding, series) checks your IQ.

#### **Week 5: Number Systems & Permutations**
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Divisibility Rules:** Focus on 3, 4, 9, and 11.
    * **Unit Digit:** Cyclicity patterns (e.g., powers of 2 repeat every 4 times: 2, 4, 8, 6).
    * **Permutations:** Arrangements (Ordering matters). **Combinations:** Selections (Order doesn't matter).

| Difficulty | Problem Type (PYQ Style) | Key Concept Refined |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beginner** | Find the unit digit of $234^{102} + 234^{103}$. | Cyclicity of numbers. |
| **Intermediate** | How many words can be formed using "BANANA"? | Permutation with repetition ($n! / p! q!$). |
| **Advanced** | In how many ways can a cricket team of 11 be chosen from 15 players if the Captain is always included and one injured player is always excluded? | Restricted Combination logic. |

#### **Week 6: Logical Reasoning Core**
* **Topics:** Coding-Decoding, Blood Relations, Direction Sense.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Coding:** Write A-M (1-13) and N-Z (14-26) below it on rough sheet before test starts.
    * **Blood Relations:** Draw a "Family Tree" using symbols (+ for Male, - for Female, = for Marriage).

| Difficulty | Problem Type (PYQ Style) | Key Concept Refined |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beginner** | Pointing to a man, a lady said, "His mother is the only daughter of my mother." Who is the man? | Breaking down relationships step-by-step. |
| **Intermediate** | If RED is coded as 360, how is GREEN coded? | Numerical value summation/multiplication logic. |
| **Advanced** | Coded Blood Relations: If $A+B$ means A is father of B... find relationship between P and Q in equation $P-R+Q$. | Decoding symbol-based logic chains. |

### **Phase 4: Advanced Logic & Mock Tests (Weeks 7-8)**

#### **Week 7: Data Interpretation (DI) & Syllogisms**
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **DI:** Don't calculate exact values. Use approximation (e.g., $124/512 \approx 125/500 = 1/4 = 25\%$).
    * **Syllogisms:** Use Venn Diagrams. "Some A are B" $\neq$ "Some A are not B".
    * **Seating Arrangement:** Circular (facing center vs. outward) vs Linear.

| Difficulty | Problem Type (PYQ Style) | Key Concept Refined |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beginner** | Statement: All rain is water. No water is blue. Conclusion: Some rain is blue? | Basic Venn Diagram validity. |
| **Intermediate** | Bar Graph interpretation: Calculate % growth of sales from Year 1 to Year 2. | Visual estimation & % change formula. |
| **Advanced** | 8 people sitting in a circle, some facing center, some facing out. | Multi-variable arrangement logic. |

#### **Week 8: The "Mock Mode" & Review**
* **Activity:**
    * **Days 1-4:** Take **1 Full-Length Mock Test** (e.g., 60 mins) daily.
    * **Strategy:** Practice the **"Skip Strategy"**. If a question takes >1.5 mins, skip it and come back.
    * **Sources:** Use platforms like *Indiabix*, *GeeksForGeeks*, or *PrepInsta* for company-specific mocks (TCS NQT, Wipro Elite).
    * **Analysis:** Spend 1 hour analyzing *why* you got a question wrong. Was it a concept gap or a silly mistake?
