Below is an 8‑week, 80–20 style plan to get you placement‑ready for aptitude/online assessments.  

**Philosophy (80–20):**  
We’ll focus on the ~20% of topics that appear again and again and can quickly boost your score:

1. **Arithmetic:** Percentages, ratios, averages, profit & loss, SI/CI, time–speed–distance, time & work.  
2. **Number Sense:** Divisibility, LCM/HCF, remainders, basic modular arithmetic.  
3. **Data:** Tables, bar graphs, pie charts, basic DI.  
4. **Core Logical Reasoning:** Arrangements, selections, simple puzzles.  
5. **Core Verbal:** Reading comprehension, sentence correction, basic logic.  

Each week:  
- **4 days:** Learn + practice core topics.  
- **2 days:** Mixed timed practice (10–20 questions).  
- **1 day:** Review errors + light revision.

I’ll give:  
- Weekly topics.  
- 80–20 focus inside each topic.  
- Problem types (beginner → intermediate → advanced) with short descriptions and the core concepts they build.  
- When I say “PYQ,” you can search like: *“TCS NQT time and work PYQ”*, *“Infosys aptitude profit loss previous year questions”*, etc., and choose problems matching the type.
