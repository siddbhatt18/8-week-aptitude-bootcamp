## 💡 Golden Rules for Success

1. **Consistency > Intensity**: 2 hours daily > 10 hours weekly
2. **Analysis > Practice**: Understanding why you got it wrong matters more
3. **Speed follows Accuracy**: First get it right, then get it fast
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Most questions are variations of 50-60 base patterns
5. **Elimination Technique**: Sometimes finding what's NOT the answer is faster

Remember: This plan covers the critical 20% that appears in 80% of placement tests. Master these first, then expand to other topics. Focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing solutions.

**Track your progress daily and adjust the pace based on your comfort level. Good luck with your preparation!** 🚀
