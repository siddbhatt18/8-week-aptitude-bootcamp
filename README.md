- **Each week includes**  
  1. Core topics  
  2. Key formulas & shortcuts (concepts)  
  3. Daily structure (minimum)  
  4. Suggested problem types with *increasing difficulty (B → I → A)*

## Week 1 – Number Sense, Percentages & Ratios (Foundation)

### 1. Topics (Core 20%)

- Number System basics  
  - Types of numbers: natural, whole, integers, primes, composites  
  - Divisibility rules for 2,3,4,5,8,9,11  
  - LCM & HCF (using prime factorization and quick shortcuts)

- Percentages & Ratios  
  - Converting between fraction–%–decimal quickly  
  - Percentage increase/decrease  
  - Basic ratio and proportion; concept of “parts”

### 2. Key Concepts & Shortcuts

- **Percentage conversions**:  
  - 1/2 = 50%, 1/3 = 33.33%, 1/4 = 25%, 1/5 = 20%, 1/8 = 12.5%, etc.  
  - Practice these till they are instant.

- **Increase/Decrease**:  
  - If value increases by x%, multiply by (1 + x/100).  
  - Decrease by x% ⇒ multiply by (1 – x/100).

- **Quick ratio to fraction**:  
  - Ratio 2:3 ⇒ parts = 5.

  - After each mock: categorize errors:  
    - Conceptual (not understood)  
    - Silly (carelessness)  
    - Speed (ran out of time)

  - Targeted drills on weak topics that same day (10–15 focused Q).

  - Filter by: Arithmetic, DI, TSD, T&W, LR  
- For each problem you get wrong or take too long:  
  - Re-solve without time limit.  
  - Identify what would have made it faster (shortcut, precomputed fraction, better diagram).

## General Tips for Independent Problem-Solving

1. **Always attempt to solve yourself before seeing solutions.**  
   Even 5–7 mins of struggle builds pattern recognition.

2. **Maintain a “Mistake Book”.**  
   - For every wrong/slow question: note topic, reason, and the *correct* way.  
   - Revisit these weekly; many questions repeat patterns.

3. **Focus on standard templates.**  
   - Most PYQs fall into recognizable patterns (e.g., “A & B work … then C joins”, “train + platform”, “profit with discount”, “age ratio now vs past/future”).  
   - Once you see the template, solving becomes mechanical.

4. **Speed comes from familiarity, not rushing.**  
   - First 3–4 weeks: focus more on accuracy.  
   - Later weeks: introduce time constraints.

5. **Company-specific tuning (after Week 5–6):**  
   - Look at 1–2 recent PYQ sets for target companies.  
   - Note which topics appear the most; spend extra practice time there.

---

If you tell me the exam timeframe and target companies (e.g., TCS NQT, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, product-based like Zoho, MAANG internships, etc.), I can tune this 8‑week plan into a company-specific weekly question mix and recommended number of questions per day.
