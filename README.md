## 0. The 80–20 Core: What You Actually Need

These are the high-ROI topics we’ll focus on:

**Core Quant & DI (≈80% of OA questions)**  
1. Percentages, Profit & Loss, Discounts  
2. Ratio & Proportion, Averages, Mixtures/Alligation  
3. Time, Speed & Distance  
4. Time & Work, Pipes & Cisterns  
5. Simple & Compound Interest  
6. Basic Numbers: divisibility, LCM/HCF, remainders, last digits  
7. Basic Algebra: linear equations & inequalities  
8. Data Interpretation: tables, bar/line charts, pie charts, caselets  

**Core Logical Reasoning (very common in OAs)**  
9. Arrangements & puzzles  
10. Selection/grouping, blood relations, directions, coding-decoding, series  

We’ll cover all these in 8 weeks, with weekly PYQ‑style problems (increasing difficulty).  
I’ll describe each *problem type*, give a few **practice problems**, and list the **key concepts** it reinforces.

    - Redo every wrong question the same day *without* seeing solution first.
    - Note which topics consistently cause problems, and quickly revise those.

---

## How to Keep Improving Speed & Accuracy

1. **Speed:**
   - Convert common fractions to % and vice versa (1/3=33.33%, 1/6=16.67%, 3/8=37.5%, etc.).
   - Practice mental math: multiply 2-digit numbers, approximate quickly.
   - Always start a test by scanning and doing the *easiest* questions first.

2. **Accuracy:**
   - For calculation-heavy questions, quickly estimate the answer range before computing; use answer options to cross-check.
   - In DI and LR, spend first 30–40 seconds just **reading & setting up** (drawing table/diagram) correctly.

3. **Analysis Habit:**
   - Maintain a small notebook:
     - Left page: question types you got wrong or took too long.  
     - Right page: “lesson learned / trick / formula / pattern recognition”.

---

If you’d like, next step I can:
- Turn one specific week (say Week 1 or Week 3) into a **full problem set with answers**, or  
- Help design **mock test blueprints** similar to specific companies’ patterns.
