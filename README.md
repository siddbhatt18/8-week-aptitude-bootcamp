This study plan uses the **Pareto Principle (80-20 Rule)**. In placement assessments (TCS, Wipro, Infosys, Accenture, Amazon, etc.), **Arithmetic and Logical Reasoning** constitute the vital 20% of topics that solve 80% of the questions. We will skip complex Geometry and pure Trigonometry initially, as their frequency is lower compared to the time required to master them.

### **Pre-requisites (The "Speed" Toolkit)**
*Before starting Week 1, spend 2 days memorizing:*
1.  Tables up to 20.
2.  Squares up to 30.
3.  Cubes up to 15.
4.  **Percentage-to-Fraction equivalents** (e.g., 1/8 = 12.5%, 1/6 = 16.66%). *This is the single most important tool for speed.*

### **Week 1: The Backbone (Percentages, Profit & Loss)**
*Why:* These concepts are the foundation for Data Interpretation (DI) and Interest problems.

**Key Concepts to Master:**
*   **A% of B = B% of A.**
*   **Multiplication Factor:** If A increases by 20%, A becomes 1.2A.
*   **Successive Percentage Change:** $a + b + (ab/100)$.
*   **Profit on Selling Price vs. Cost Price.**

**Problem Progression:**
1.  **Beginner:** "If A’s income is 25% more than B’s, by what percent is B’s income less than A’s?"
    *   *Concept:* Base change rule.
2.  **Intermediate (PYQ Style):** "A shopkeeper marks his goods 40% above cost price and gives a discount of 20% on the marked price. Find his gain percentage."
    *   *Concept:* Successive change and Markup/Discount relationship.
3.  **Advanced:** "A trader sells two articles at Rs. 990 each. On one, he gains 10% and on the other, he loses 10%. Find the overall gain or loss percentage and value."
    *   *Concept:* Same Selling Price logic (always leads to a loss of $x^2/100$ %).

### **Week 2: Ratios, Mixtures & Averages**
*Why:* The "Method of Allegation" learned here is a shortcut cheat code for solving difficult problems in <30 seconds.

**Key Concepts to Master:**
*   **Ratio Balancing:** Combining A:B and B:C into A:B:C.
*   **Weighted Average Formula.**
*   **Rule of Allegation:** Visual method to solve mixture problems.

**Problem Progression:**
1.  **Beginner:** "The ratio of boys to girls is 3:2. If 10 boys leave and 10 girls join, the ratio becomes 2:3. Find original strength."
    *   *Concept:* Cross-multiplication method.
2.  **Intermediate (PYQ Style):** "In what ratio must rice at Rs. 40/kg be mixed with rice at Rs. 60/kg so that the mixture is worth Rs. 55/kg?"
    *   *Concept:* Pure Application of Allegation.
3.  **Advanced:** "A container contains 40 liters of milk. From this, 4 liters are taken out and replaced with water. This process is repeated two more times. How much milk is now in the container?"
    *   *Concept:* Compound replacement formula: $Final = Initial \times (1 - \frac{removed}{total})^n$.

---

### **Week 3: Rate Problems I (Time & Work, Pipes & Cisterns)**
*Why:* Every single placement exam has 2-3 questions from this.

**Key Concepts to Master:**
*   **The LCM Method:** (Forget the $1/x$ school method). Assume Total Work = LCM of days taken.
*   **Efficiency:** $Work = Efficiency \times Time$.
*   **Negative Efficiency:** Leaks in pipes.

**Problem Progression:**
1.  **Beginner:** "A does work in 10 days, B in 15 days. How long will they take working together?"
    *   *Concept:* Total Work = 30 units (LCM). Add efficiencies.
2.  **Intermediate (PYQ Style):** "A and B start working together. A leaves 2 days before the completion of the work. The total work took 10 days. How long would A take alone?"
    *   *Concept:* Calculating work done by B alone in the last 2 days vs work done together.
3.  **Advanced:** "Men, Women, and Children wage/efficiency problem (e.g., 3 Men or 5 Women can do a job in 12 days...)"
    *   *Concept:* Converting 'Or' conditions into 'And' equations; efficiency ratios.

---

### **Week 4: Rate Problems II (Time, Speed, Distance - TSD)**
*Why:* TSD separates the average students from the top scorers.

**Key Concepts to Master:**
*   **Proportionality:** If Distance is constant, Speed is inversely proportional to Time ($S \propto 1/T$).
*   **Relative Speed:** Same direction (subtract), Opposite direction (add).
*   **Trains crossing poles vs. platforms.**

**Problem Progression:**
1.  **Beginner:** "A train 100m long crosses a pole in 10 seconds. Find speed in km/hr."
    *   *Concept:* Unit conversion ($m/s \times 18/5 = km/hr$).
2.  **Intermediate (PYQ Style):** "A student walks at 4 km/hr and reaches school 5 min late. If he walks at 5 km/hr, he reaches 10 min early. Find the distance."
    *   *Concept:* Product of speeds / Difference of speeds $\times$ Difference in time.
3.  **Advanced:** "Two guns were fired from the same place at an interval of 12 mins. A person approaching the place hears the 2nd shot 11 mins 30 sec after the first. Find the speed of the person if sound travels at 330 m/s."
    *   *Concept:* Distance traveled by sound in 30s = Distance traveled by man in 11m 30s.

---

### **Week 5: Number System & Sequences**
*Why:* Frequently asked in "Quantitative Ability" and "Coding" sections (logic building).

**Key Concepts to Master:**
*   **Divisibility Rules:** Specifically 3, 4, 9, 11.
*   **Unit Digit Calculation:** Cyclicity of numbers (2, 3, 7, 8 have cyclicity 4).
*   **HCF & LCM:** Real-life applications (bells tolling together).
*   **AP/GP Basics.**

**Problem Progression:**
1.  **Beginner:** "Find the unit digit of $7^{105}$."
    *   *Concept:* Cyclicity and remainders.
2.  **Intermediate (PYQ Style):** "What is the smallest number which when divided by 12, 15, and 18 leaves a remainder of 7 in each case?"
    *   *Concept:* $LCM(12, 15, 18) + Remainder$.
3.  **Advanced:** "Find the remainder when $2^{99}$ is divided by 33."
    *   *Concept:* Remainder Theorem / Euler's Totient (simplified).

---

### **Week 6: Modern Math (Permutation, Combination, Probability)**
*Why:* High weightage in IT companies (TCS/Infosys) and relatively easy once logic is understood.

**Key Concepts to Master:**
*   **Counting Principle:** AND = Multiply, OR = Add.
*   **Permutation (Arrangement):** Order matters.
*   **Combination (Selection):** Order doesn't matter.

**Problem Progression:**
1.  **Beginner:** "In how many ways can the letters of the word APPLE be arranged?"
    *   *Concept:* $n! / p!$ (handling repetition).
2.  **Intermediate (PYQ Style):** "From a group of 5 men and 4 women, a team of 4 is to be selected such that it contains at least 2 women."
    *   *Concept:* Cases method (Add combinations of different scenarios).
3.  **Advanced:** "What is the probability that a leap year selected at random will contain 53 Sundays?"
    *   *Concept:* Sample space of the extra days in a leap year.

### **Week 7: Logical Reasoning (The "High Accuracy" Zone)**
*Why:* You can score 100% here. It relies on structure, not math formulas.

**Topics:**
1.  **Coding-Decoding:** Pattern recognition (shifted letters, reverse alphabets).
2.  **Blood Relations:** Draw family trees (use symbols for gender and generation gaps).
3.  **Seating Arrangement:** Linear and Circular (facing inside/outside).
4.  **Syllogisms:** Venn Diagram method (All A are B, Some B are C).

**Problem Progression:**
1.  **Beginner:** "If CAT is coded as DBU, how is DOG coded?" (Shift +1).
2.  **Intermediate:** Circular arrangement of 6 people facing the center.
3.  **Advanced:** Syllogisms with "Possibility" cases or Linear arrangement with variable attributes (Person + Color of shirt).

---

### **Week 8: Data Interpretation (DI) & Integration**
*Why:* DI bundles 5 questions at once. It tests calculation speed (Week 1 skills).

**Activities:**
*   **Practice:** Tables, Bar Graphs, Pie Charts.
*   **Technique:** Look for "Observation" questions (where you don't need to calculate, just compare bar heights).
*   **Approximation:** Do not calculate 1234/5678 exactly. Treat it as 12/57.

**The Week 8 Routine:**
1.  Take 1 Full-Length Mock Test (Assessment platform like Indiabix, GeeksforGeeks, or specific company mock).
2.  **Analyze:** If you missed a TSD question, review Week 4 concepts.

### **How to Practice (The Strategy)**

1.  **Don't read, Solve:** Aptitude is not history. You must have a pen and paper.
2.  **The "5-Problem" Rule:** For every topic, solve:
    *   5 Formula based.
    *   5 Word problems.
    *   5 Previous Year Questions (PYQs).
3.  **Resources:**
    *   *IndiaBix:* For topic-wise beginner questions.
    *   *FacePrep / PrepInsta:* For company-specific PYQs.
    *   *YouTube:* CareerRide or FeelFreeToLearn (for concept videos).

**Follow this plan, and by Week 8, you will be able to handle the core 80% of any placement assessment.**
