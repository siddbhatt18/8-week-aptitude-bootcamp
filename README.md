Below is an 8‑week, 80‑20 based aptitude plan focused on getting you ready for placement online assessments.  

**Principles used:**

- **80–20:** We’ll focus on the ~20% of topics & skills that appear most frequently and give maximum score gain.  
- **Learn → Drill → Timed Practice:** Each week: learn core concepts, do focused practice by type, then take mixed questions under light time pressure.  
- **PYQ-oriented thinking:** I’ll describe very typical “Previous Year Question” (PYQ) patterns rather than linking to specific company sets, so you can find similar ones on any platform (IndiaBix, PrepInsta, GeeksforGeeks, etc.).

## How to Approach Practice & Problem-Solving (General Tips)

1. **For every new topic:**
   - Learn **basic formula + 2–3 solved examples**.  
   - Do **10–20 practice problems**, starting slow, then speed up.

2. **Use timer smartly:**
   - Initially ignore time; focus on understanding.  
   - After 2–3 days on a topic, start solving sets **with a timer**.

3. **Maintain an “Error Log”:**
   - For each tough/wrong question, jot down:
     - Topic  
     - What you did wrong  
     - Correct approach (1–2 lines)  
   - Review this log twice a week.

4. **Focus on patterns, not just answers:**
   - After solving examples, ask:
     - What kind of question is this?  
     - Which concept(s) did it use?
     - Can I solve it faster with an alternate method?

5. **Gradual Level Increase:**
   - Start from **beginner** types targetting **100% accuracy**.  
   - Then move to **intermediate** while keeping accuracy ≥ 80%.  
   - Only then start on **advanced** sets and timed sections.

## After 8 Weeks – Transition to Company-Specific Mocks

Once you finish this 8-week plan:

1. Attempt **company-specific PYQ mocks** (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, etc.).  
2. Post-mock analysis:
   - Topic-wise accuracy  
   - Time taken per question  
   - Identify **3 weakest micro-topics** and revise.  
3. Keep at least **2 full mocks/week** until your actual exams.
