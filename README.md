## **Final Tips for Placement Success**

### During Preparation
1. **Use pen-paper**: Don't rely only on calculators
2. **Time yourself**: Always practice with a timer
3. **Skip strategically**: In mocks, skip if >2 mins spent
4. **Pattern recognition**: Notice common question types

### During Actual Test
1. **Read instructions**: Negative marking? Sectional cutoffs?
2. **Easy first**: Scan all questions, pick low-hanging fruits
3. **Accuracy > Attempts**: 20/25 better than 15/30
4. **Last 5 mins**: Guess only if no negative marking

### Psychological Preparation
- **Week 1-4**: Be patient, concepts take time
- **Week 5-6**: You'll feel comfortable with formulas
- **Week 7-8**: Confidence peaks, trust your preparation

---

## **Customization Based on Your Progress**

**If you find Week X too easy:**
- Increase advanced problems from 30% to 50%
- Move to next week's concepts in Days 6-7

**If you find Week X too difficult:**
- Extend to 9-10 days instead of 7
- Focus more on beginner/intermediate (80% time)
- Reduce daily problem count but maintain consistency

**Track this weekly**: 
- If accuracy < target by 10% → Slow down, focus on concepts
- If speed > target by 1 min → Time to push difficulty level

---

## **Week-by-Week Milestones**

✅ **End of Week 2**: You should be able to solve basic company aptitude tests (like TCS NQT)

✅ **End of Week 4**: You can attempt mid-tier company tests (Cognizant, Capgemini)

✅ **End of Week 6**: You're ready for product-based company quantitative sections (with more LR/Coding)

✅ **End of Week 8**: You can confidently appear for any placement OA with 70-80% expected accuracy
