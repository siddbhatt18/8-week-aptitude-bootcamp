Below is an 8‑week, 80–20 style plan: you’ll focus on the ~20% of aptitude concepts that show up in 80% of placement tests (online assessments).  

Core areas we’ll hit repeatedly:
- Arithmetic: Percentages, Ratio–Proportion, Averages, Simple/Compound Interest, Profit–Loss, Time–Speed–Distance, Time & Work.
- Number Systems: Divisibility, LCM/HCF, Remainders.
- Algebra basics: Linear equations, inequalities.
- Data Interpretation (DI) & Basic Logical Reasoning.
- A bit of Probability & Permutation–Combination (only the most common patterns).

Each week:
- 4–5 core topics.
- Concept → drilled examples → selected PYQ‑style problems (increasing difficulty).
- Daily: 1–1.5 hours (concept + practice) on weekdays, 2–3 hours mock/mixed practice on weekends.

“PYQ problems” below are generic recreations of the style/level seen in TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Capgemini, Cognizant, etc. You can find exact past questions on platforms like PrepInsta, GeeksforGeeks, IndiaBix, and company-specific sheets; use these descriptions/keywords to match them.

## Week 8 – Full Mock Tests, Strategy, and Fine-Tuning

**Goal:** Simulate real test environment & refine test-taking strategy.

### Focus Areas

1. Exam Strategy
   - Attempt easy questions first (one pass).
   - Skip and mark time-consuming ones for second pass.
   - Manage sectional timing (if applicable).

2. Full-Length Mock Tests
   - Ideally: 3–4 full mocks over the week.  
     Each: 60–90 min, 30–40 aptitude questions (depending on pattern of target companies).

3. Post-Mock Analysis (Most Important)
   For each mock:
   - Categorize wrong Qs into:
     1. Conceptual gap (you truly didn’t know).
     2. Misread question / silly error.
     3. Time management issue (couldn’t finish).
   - For (1): Revisit that topic (e.g., remainder theorems, Alligation formula, etc.).
   - For (2): Train yourself to underline keywords (not, at least, at most, more than, etc.).
   - For (3): Learn to skip early; don’t get stuck.

## Where to Find Actual PYQs / Practice Sets

Search for these keywords/platforms and match them with the “problem types” above:

- Platforms:
  - GeeksforGeeks – “Aptitude for Placements”
  - PrepInsta – company-wise questions (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, Capgemini, etc.)
  - IndiaBix – topic-wise questions.
- Search phrases:
  - “TCS NQT previous year aptitude questions pdf”
  - “Infosys aptitude PYQ with solutions”
  - “Wipro Elite NLTH aptitude questions”
  - “Capgemini aptitude practice questions”

Filter by **topic** (Percentages, Time & Work, DI, etc.) and difficulty (easy–medium–hard). Use the problem descriptions above to tag each question you solve.

---

## Final Tips for Speed & Accuracy

1. **Mental Math Practice**
   - Daily 5–10 min:  
     - Squares up to 30, cubes up to 15, common fractions–percentages (1/2=50%, 1/3≈33.3%, 1/4=25%, etc.).
   - This alone will cut 20–30 seconds per question.

2. **Pattern Recognition Over Rote**
   - Ask “What type is this?” before solving:
     - “This is a mixture–replacement question.”  
     - “This is a work-rate with people entering/leaving.”  
   - Once type is clear, use the standard template.

3. **Timed Sets, Not Single Questions**
   - Always practice 5–10 questions in a row with a timer, not just one-by-one untimed.

4. **Error Log Is Your Gold**
   - Don’t just do new questions. Re-solve your own wrong/marked questions weekly.

If you share:
- Which companies you’re mainly targeting, and  
- Rough current comfort level (e.g., totally new vs. some school-level familiarity),

I can customize this 8‑week outline into a day-by-day schedule with specific daily question counts and suggested online resources per topic.
