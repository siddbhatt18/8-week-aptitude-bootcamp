Here is a structured **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 3**, focused on:

- Time & Work  
- Pipes & Cisterns  

Target: **~1.5–2.5 hours per day**. Adjust up/down as needed.

---

## Core Ideas for Week 3

Keep these in mind all week:

- If A alone can do a work in **x days**, then  
  - A’s **1-day work** = 1/x  
- If A and B work together:  
  - Combined 1-day work = 1/x + 1/y  
- Time taken together = 1 / (combined 1-day work)  
- Pipes & cisterns are the same concept: **“filling = positive work, emptying = negative work”**.

---

## Day 1 – Time & Work: Basics & One-Person Problems

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Work–Time Relationship**

- If total work = W and time = T days, then:
  - Daily work = W / T
- In aptitude, we often **assume total work = LCM** of individual times to avoid fractions.

b) **Key Formulas**

- If A can complete a job in x days:  
  - A’s 1-day work = 1/x (taking total work = 1 unit).  
- If A works for t days:  
  - Work done = t/x.

c) **Understanding Percent of Work**

- If A does 1/x per day, then:
  - In t days: (t/x) part of work done.  
  - Remaining work = 1 – (t/x).

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

Use any aptitude source; target these types:

**Beginner**

1. A can finish a work in 10 days.  
   - (a) How much work does A do in 1 day?  
   - (b) In how many days will A finish 1/2 of the work?  
2. B can complete a work in 8 days.  
   - (a) How much work in 3 days?  
   - (b) What fraction of work is left after 5 days?

3. C can do a work in 6 days. Find:
   - (a) 1-day work  
   - (b) Time to finish 1/3 of the work.

**Intermediate**

4. A can complete a work in 12 days. He works for 4 days and leaves. What fraction is left?  
5. B can complete a work in 15 days. After B worked for 5 days, C finished the remaining work in 10 days. How many days would C take to do whole work alone?  
   - Work by B in 5 days = 5/15 = 1/3; remaining = 2/3; C does 2/3 in 10 days → deduce C’s full time.

**Reinforces**

- 1/x concept  
- Translating days ↔ fraction of work  
- Solving simple fraction equations

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 short questions:  
  - Given time alone, find 1-day work and partial work in “t” days.  
- Aim: 12–15 minutes.  
- Focus on clean fraction handling.

### 4. Reflection (5–10 min)

- Write any small mistakes you made:
  - Wrong fraction?  
  - Misinterpretation of “work done” vs “work left”?  
- Note it in your mistake notebook.

---

## Day 2 – Two-Person Time & Work Problems

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Combining Work Rates**

- If A takes x days and B takes y days:  
  - A’s 1-day work = 1/x  
  - B’s 1-day work = 1/y  
  - Together: 1-day work = 1/x + 1/y  
  - Time together = 1 ÷ (1/x + 1/y)

b) **Using LCM Approach (for intuition)**

- Assume total work = LCM(x, y).  
  - A’s rate = total work / x  
  - B’s rate = total work / y  
  - Combined rate = sum of rates  
  - Time = total / combined rate

Both methods are equivalent; use whichever feels easier.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. A can do a piece of work in 10 days, B in 15 days. How long will they take together?  
2. A can do a work in 12 days, B in 20 days. Time together?

**Intermediate**

3. A and B together can do a job in 6 days. A alone can do it in 10 days. In how many days can B alone complete it?  
4. B and C together can finish a work in 8 days. C alone can do it in 24 days. Time for B alone?  
5. A, B, and C can do a work in 12, 15, and 20 days respectively. In how many days will they finish it together?  
   - First find combined rate: 1/12 + 1/15 + 1/20.

**Advanced (1–2 problems)**

6. A and B together can finish a work in 10 days. B and C in 15 days, and A and C in 20 days. In how many days can A alone finish it?  
   - Let A,B,C rates be a, b, c. Use:  
     - a+b = 1/10  
     - b+c = 1/15  
     - a+c = 1/20  
   - Solve to find a.

**Reinforces**

- Add/subtract work rates  
- Handling 2-person and 3-person combinations  
- Simple systems of equations with rates

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 6–8 two-person problems (like examples 1–5).  
- Time: 15 minutes.  
- Goal: recognize pattern quickly and write work rates directly.

### 4. Quick Summary (5–10 min)

- Write generic steps for:
  - “Given individual times → find combined time”  
  - “Given combined + one individual → find the other individual”

---

## Day 3 – Time & Work: Advanced Patterns (Alternate Days, Partial Work, Efficiency)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Efficiency Concept**

- If A takes x days and B takes y days for same work:  
  - Efficiency ∝ 1/time.  
  - Efficiency ratio (A:B) = y:x.

b) **Alternate Days / Limited Days**

- A works on some days, B on some days. Use 1-day work idea or 2-day cycle, etc.

c) **Partial Work & Leftover**

- A and B start together; one leaves after a while; remaining is finished by another.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. A is twice as efficient as B. Together, they finish a job in 12 days. In how many days will A alone finish it?  
   - Let B’s 1-day work = x, then A = 2x, total = 3x = 1/12.

2. A can do a work in 16 days, B in 24 days. They work together for 6 days, then A leaves. In how many more days will B finish the rest?

**Intermediate**

3. A and B can do a work in 18 days and 27 days respectively. They work on alternate days, starting with A. In how many days will the work complete?  
   - Compute work in 2 days (A+B), then break into cycles.

4. A alone can complete a work in 12 days. B alone in 18 days. They start together, but B leaves after 4 days. In how many total days is work finished?

5. A and B together can finish a work in 10 days. They work together for 6 days, then A leaves. B finishes the remaining work in 8 more days. In how many days could B finish the entire work alone?

**Advanced (1–2 problems)**

6. A and B together can do a piece of work in 4 days. B and C in 6 days, C and A in 8 days. They all work together for 1 day, then C leaves. How many days more will A and B take to finish the remaining work?

**Reinforces**

- Using efficiency ratios instead of absolute days  
- Handling alternating/partial participation  
- Organizing multi-stage work systematically

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 5–7 mixed problems (efficiency, partial work).  
- Try within 15 minutes; focus on writing 1-day work cleanly and tracking remaining work.

### 4. Reflection (5–10 min)

- Note which pattern confused you:  
  - Alternate days?  
  - Person leaving?  
  - Efficiency ratio?

Flag them for extra revision later.

## Day 4 – Pipes & Cisterns: Basics (Single & Two Pipes)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Analogy to Time & Work**

- Think of “filling a tank” as “doing work”:
  - If a pipe fills tank in x hours → 1-hour filling = 1/x of tank.  
  - If an outlet empties in y hours → 1-hour work = –1/y (negative).

b) **Basic Formulas**

- One pipe A fills in x hours → 1/x per hour.  
- Two pipes A and B: (1/x + 1/y) per hour.  
- If one fills, one empties: net rate = 1/x – 1/y (sign depends).

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. A pipe can fill a tank in 6 hours. How much part of the tank is filled in:  
   - (a) 1 hour  
   - (b) 2 hours  
   - (c) 3 hours?  

2. A pipe fills a tank in 5 hours, another in 10 hours. How long to fill tank if both opened together?  
3. Pipe A fills in 8 hours, pipe B fills in 12 hours. Together?

**Intermediate**

4. A pipe fills a tank in 4 hours, B in 6 hours. If both are opened together, how long will they take to fill the tank 3/4 full?  
5. A tank can be filled by a pipe in 9 hours and emptied by an outlet in 12 hours. If both opened together, in how many hours will the tank fill?

6. A tank can be filled by A in 10 hours and by B in 15 hours. A is opened for 3 hours alone, then B is also opened. How much more time is required to fill the tank?

**Reinforces**

- Translating to rate-per-hour  
- Handling filling + emptying cases  
- Solving for partial filling

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 6–8 basic pipe problems (1 or 2 pipes only).  
- Target: 15 minutes.  
- Emphasize getting rate signs (positive/negative) correct.

### 4. Quick Recap (5–10 min)

- List mappings:  
  - “x days” in work ↔ “x hours” in pipes  
  - “1-day work” ↔ “1-hour fill”

---

## Day 5 – Pipes & Cisterns: Complex Cases (More Pipes, Start/Stop, Inlet vs Outlet)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Multiple Pipes**

- 3 pipes: A (fill), B (fill), C (empty).  
- Net 1-hour work = 1/x + 1/y – 1/z.

b) **Start/Stop Scenarios**

- One pipe works for some time, then others join or close.  
- Compute work done in each phase.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. Pipe A fills tank in 3 hours, B in 6 hours, outlet C empties it in 9 hours. If all opened together, in how many hours will the tank be full?

2. A tank can be filled by three pipes A, B and C in 6, 8 and 12 hours respectively. Find time taken if:  
   - (a) only A & B are opened  
   - (b) A & B for 2 hours then C also opened.

**Intermediate**

3. Pipe A can fill a tank in 4 hours; B can fill it in 6 hours. C can empty it in 12 hours. Initially, only A and B are opened for 1 hour. Then C is also opened. Find the total time to fill the tank.

4. A tank is 3/4 full. Pipe A can fill in 8 hours, pipe B in 12 hours. Both pipes are opened. How long to completely fill tank?

5. Pipe A alone can fill in 5 hours. It is opened alone for 2 hours, then B is opened and both together fill remaining in 3 hours. How long would B take alone?

**Advanced (1–2 problems)**

6. There are two inlet pipes A and B and one outlet C. A fills tank in 10 hours, B in 15 hours, C empties it in 30 hours. All are opened together; after some time C is closed and tank gets filled in 10 hours total. After how many hours was C closed?  
   - Let C work for t hours with A & B, and remaining (10–t) hours only A & B.

**Reinforces**

- Multi-phase work distribution  
- Net rates with multiple filling and emptying  
- Setting up linear equations in t

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 5–7 pipe problems, mixed difficulty.  
- Try within 15 minutes.  
- Focus: clearly define each phase and rate.

### 4. Short Reflection (5–10 min)

- Identify where mistakes happen:
  - Wrong net rate sign?  
  - Miscounting time intervals?  
- Write a checklist for multi-stage problems.

## Day 6 – Mixed Practice: Time & Work + Pipes (Exam-Style)

### 1. Quick Revision (20–30 min)

- Skim your notes on:
  - 1/x idea for workers and pipes  
  - Combining rates  
  - Efficiency ratios  
  - Start/stop, alternate days, partial work

### 2. Mixed Problem Set (60–75 min)

Try to solve in one sitting, close to exam style.

**Time & Work (8–10 Q)**

Include a mix of:

1. Basic two-person work together.  
2. One leaves partway.  
3. Efficiency-based (A is k times as efficient as B).  
4. Simple “A+B”, “B+C”, “A+C” type combined-rate problems.

Examples:

- A can do a work in 15 days, B in 25 days. Together?  
- A is 50% more efficient than B. Together, they finish in 18 days. Find time for B alone.  
- A and B can do a work in 10 days; B and C in 15; A and C in 20. Find time for A alone.  
- A and B work 4 days together, then A leaves and B finishes in 6 extra days. B alone would take how many days?

**Pipes & Cisterns (6–8 Q)**

- Mixture of:
  - 2-pipe, 3-pipe  
  - Inlet + outlet  
  - Start/stop scenarios

Examples:

- A fills in 9 hrs, B in 12 hrs. Both together?  
- A fills in 6 hrs, B empties in 8 hrs. If both opened in empty tank, time to fill?  
- A fills in 4 hrs; A+B fill in 2.4 hrs. Time for B alone?

Try to:

- Solve **14–18 problems** in **60–75 minutes**.

### 3. Review (20–30 min)

- Check solutions. For each error:
  - Was it concept, calculation, or misreading?  
  - Re-solve correctly and note short solution in your mistake book.

- Identify if you are consistently:
  - Mixing up 1/x vs x  
  - Mishandling fractions/finding LCM  
  - Losing track of remaining work

---

## Day 7 – Weekly Revision + Mini-Mock

### 1. Concept Recap (40–50 min)

Revisit:

- Time & Work:
  - 1/x and combined 1/x + 1/y forms  
  - Efficiency ratios (A faster than B)  
  - Patterns: one leaves, alternate days, multiple combos

- Pipes & Cisterns:
  - Filling vs emptying (signs)  
  - Net rate for multiple pipes  
  - Multi-phase start/stop problems

For each subtopic, do 1–2 “representative” problems from your notes without looking at answers.

### 2. Mini-Mock Test (45–60 min)

Create or pick a **20–25 question set**:

- 12–15 Time & Work (from basic to advanced)  
- 8–10 Pipes & Cisterns (range of difficulty)

Attempt:

- Time limit: 45–50 minutes  
- One sitting, test conditions

### 3. Error Analysis (25–35 min)

- Mark questions as:
  - Correct & fast  
  - Correct but slow  
  - Wrong / guessed

- For every **wrong or slow** question:
  - Note the type (T&W vs Pipes, and which pattern).  
  - Write 2–3 bullet points:  
    - “Better approach next time”  
    - “Key step I missed”  

Add toughest ones to your mistake notebook for future revision.

### 4. Prep for Next Week (5–10 min)

Week 4 is **Time, Speed & Distance (TSD), Trains, Boats & Streams**.

- Note if any core skill from this week needs revisiting (like handling rates or fractions) because TSD uses the **same idea**: speed = distance/time (rate problems again).

---

If you tell me how much time you actually spend per day (for example, 1.5 vs 3 hours), I can also suggest approximate **number of questions per day** and some free websites/apps to pull the exact problem sets from.
