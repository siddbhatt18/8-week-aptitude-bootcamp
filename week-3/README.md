Below is your **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 3**, focused on:

- Time, Speed & Distance (TSD)
- Trains, Relative Speed
- Boats & Streams
- Light revision of Weeks 1–2 (Percentages, Ratios, P&L, SI/CI)

Assume ~**2.5–3 hours/day**. As before, structure is:

> Learn concepts → Study 1–2 examples → Solve on your own → Timed practice → Reflect.

---

## Day 1 – TSD Basics: Speed, Distance, Time, Units

**Main goal:** Get fully comfortable with the core formula and unit conversions.

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

Write in your notebook and internalize:

1. **Core formula**  
   - `Speed = Distance / Time`  
   - `Distance = Speed × Time`  
   - `Time = Distance / Speed`

2. **Units**  
   - km, m; hours (h), minutes (min), seconds (s).
   - `1 hour = 60 min = 3600 s`
   - Converting:
     - 30 min = 0.5 hours  
     - 45 min = 0.75 hours  
     - 90 min = 1.5 hours  

3. **Speed unit conversions**
   - `1 km/h = (5/18) m/s`  
   - `1 m/s = (18/5) km/h`
   - Useful values to memorize:
     - 36 km/h = 10 m/s  
     - 54 km/h = 15 m/s  
     - 72 km/h = 20 m/s  

4. Simple idea: **Higher speed → less time** for same distance.

### 2. Guided Examples (15–20 min)

Work through 6–8 examples, writing all steps:

1. A car travels 150 km in 3 h. Find its speed (km/h).  
2. A cyclist goes 40 km in 2 h 30 min. Speed?  
3. At 60 km/h, how long to cover 90 km?  
4. Convert 54 km/h to m/s, and 15 m/s to km/h.  
5. A bus travels 20 m/s. How many km in 30 min?

Force yourself to:
- Convert time units carefully (minutes → hours, seconds → hours or seconds).  
- Use the conversion formulas for speed.

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner (35–45 min)

Solve **15–20 basic TSD problems**:

- 8–10 direct S, D, or T calculation.  
- 4–6 involving unit conversions.  
- 3–4 short word problems (e.g., “how far in X hours”, “how long to cover Y km”).

Rules:
- Max **2 minutes** per simple question.  
- If unit conversion confuses you, write units alongside every number.

### 4. Speed Calculation Drill (10–15 min)

Create a small table of **10 rows**:

Columns:  
- Distance (km) | Time (h or min) | Speed (km/h)

Fill in quickly, for example:
- 60 km in 1 h  
- 90 km in 1.5 h  
- 120 km in 3 h  
- 45 km in 50 min  
…etc.

Try to finish in **10–15 minutes**. This trains your arithmetic and feel for realistic speeds.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:
- Where you made most mistakes: time conversion or speed formula?  
- One unit-conversion pair you will memorize (for quick recall) tomorrow.

---

## Day 2 – Average Speed & Two-part Journeys

**Main goal:** Understand and compute average speed over multiple segments.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Key ideas:

1. **Average speed** is not (speed1 + speed2)/2 unless time or distances are equal in special ways.

2. General formula:  
   - `Average speed = Total distance / Total time`

3. Two main cases:
   - **Equal distances, different speeds**:
     - Go distance D at V1, return D at V2:  
       - Total distance = 2D  
       - Total time = D/V1 + D/V2  
       - `Avg speed = 2V1V2 / (V1 + V2)` (useful shortcut but not mandatory)
   - **Different distances**:
     - Always use total distance / total time directly.

### 2. Guided Examples (20 min)

Solve 6–8 examples:

1. A car covers first 60 km at 30 km/h and next 60 km at 60 km/h. Average speed?  
2. A person travels from A to B at 40 km/h and returns at 60 km/h. Average speed over the entire trip?  
3. A bus covers 100 km at 50 km/h and 80 km at 40 km/h. Average speed?  
4. A car travels for 2 hours at 30 km/h and then 3 hours at 50 km/h. Average speed?

Emphasize:
- Separating scenarios by distance vs time basis.  
- Always compute total distance & total time explicitly at least initially.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **15 problems**:

- 8–10 equal-distance two-speed problems.  
- 5–7 unequal-distance or time-based average speed problems.

For each:
- Write down: Total distance, each time, Total time, then Average speed.  
- Only use formula `2V1V2/(V1+V2)` when you’re sure distances are equal.

### 4. Short Challenge Set (15–20 min)

Pick **3–5 slightly tricky problems**, for example:

1. A man goes from A to B at 30 km/h and returns at 20 km/h. Total time is 5 h. Find distance AB.  
2. A car travels first half time at 40 km/h, next half at 60 km/h. Find average speed.  
3. A person covers first half of a distance at 30 km/h and second half at 50 km/h. Average speed?

Spend **3–4 min** each and reason carefully which “half” is referred to (time or distance).

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Note:
- How do you decide the method: equal distance vs equal time?  
- Did you ever mistakenly average the speeds directly?

---

## Day 3 – Relative Speed & Meeting/Opposite Direction Problems

**Main goal:** Understand relative speed and apply it to simple meeting/overtaking scenarios.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Core ideas:

1. **Relative speed**  
   - When moving in **opposite directions**:  
     - Relative speed = V1 + V2  
   - When moving in **same direction**:  
     - Relative speed = |V1 – V2|
2. Time to meet or overtake:
   - `Time = Distance between / Relative speed`

3. Think in terms of frames:
   - If you’re on one object, the other appears to approach at relative speed.

### 2. Guided Examples (20 min)

Solve 6–8 examples:

1. Two people start from points 20 km apart and move towards each other at 4 km/h and 6 km/h. Time to meet?  
2. Two cars on a straight road move in same direction at 60 km/h and 40 km/h. The faster car is 100 km behind the slower. Time to catch up?  
3. Two trains moving towards each other at 50 km/h and 70 km/h, distance between them 240 km. Time to meet?  
4. Two bikers start from same point in opposite directions at 20 km/h and 30 km/h. Distance between them after 2 h?

Make sure to:
- Convert all speeds to same units.  
- Be explicit about “towards each other” vs “same direction.”

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **15 problems**:

- 5–7 opposite-direction meet problems.  
- 5–7 same-direction chase problems.  
- 2–3 “distance between after t hours” problems.

Each time:
- Write: `Relative speed = ?`  
- State if it’s sum (opposite) or difference (same direction).

### 4. Mini Drill (10–15 min)

Create a quick table of **8–10 cases**:

Columns:  
- V1, V2, Direction (same/opp), Relative speed

Fill it as quickly as possible. No story, just practice relative speed directly.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:
- Do you ever confuse when to add vs subtract?  
- One sentence rule for yourself: (e.g., “If they run head-on, speeds add. If chasing, subtract.”)

---

## Day 4 – Trains: Length, Platforms, and Crossing Time

**Main goal:** Handle train problems: crossing a pole, a man, another train, a platform.

### 1. Concept Learning (30–35 min)

Key ideas:

1. When a train passes:
   - A **pole or stationary man**: distance covered = length of train.  
   - A **platform**: distance covered = length of train + length of platform.  
   - Another train (moving or stationary): distance covered = sum of lengths.

2. Use:
   - `Time = Distance / Relative speed`
   - Speeds often given in km/h; lengths in meters → convert speed to m/s.

3. Always convert km/h to m/s when distances are in meters:
   - `Speed (m/s) = Speed (km/h) × 5/18`

### 2. Guided Examples (20 min)

Work 6–8 examples:

1. A train 120 m long passes a pole in 6 s. Find speed in km/h.  
2. A train 150 m long passes a platform 250 m long in 20 s. Speed?  
3. Two trains of lengths 120 m and 180 m cross each other in 12 s when moving in opposite directions; speeds are 54 km/h and 36 km/h. Verify.  
4. A 200 m train passes a man walking at 5 km/h in the same direction in 10 s. Find train’s speed.

Pay attention to:
- Converting units (m/s ↔ km/h).  
- Correct distance (sum of lengths when relevant).

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **15 problems**:

- 5–6 single-train crossing pole/platform.  
- 5–6 train vs man/walker (same and opposite directions).  
- 3–4 train vs train crossings (same & opposite directions).

Write explicit steps:
- Convert given speed in km/h to m/s.  
- Compute distance (train length + platform/other train length or just train length).  
- Then Time = D / relative speed.

### 4. Short Challenge Set (15–20 min)

Try **3–5 advanced-ish train problems**, such as:

1. A train crosses a platform in 30 s and a man standing on the platform in 18 s. If train speed is known, find platform length.  
2. Two trains 150 m and 250 m, moving in same direction at 60 km/h and 45 km/h, cross each other in t seconds; find t.  
3. A train passes two men walking in same direction at different speeds, taking different times. Use this to find train length and speed.

Give yourself **4 min** per question, don’t rush to see answers.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Note:
- Do you consistently remember to convert to m/s?  
- Which type is harder for you: train + platform, or train + man, or train + train?

## Day 5 – Boats & Streams: Upstream/Downstream

**Main goal:** Learn boats-in-stream problems as a direct application of relative speed.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Key concepts:

1. If:
   - Boat speed in still water = B (km/h)  
   - Stream speed = S (km/h)

Then:
- Downstream speed (with current) = B + S  
- Upstream speed (against current) = B – S

2. Use:
   - `Time = Distance / Speed`  
   - For round trips, total time = upstream time + downstream time.

3. To find B and S from upstream and downstream speeds:
   - B = (Up + Down)/2  
   - S = (Down – Up)/2

### 2. Guided Examples (20 min)

Solve 6–8 examples:

1. A boat goes 30 km downstream in 2 h, and the same distance upstream in 3 h. Find B and S.  
2. A boat’s speed in still water is 10 km/h; stream speed is 2 km/h. Time to go 24 km downstream? Upstream?  
3. A person rows 12 km upstream and 12 km downstream in total 5 h. If stream is 2 km/h, find boat speed in still water.

Write steps:
- Identify upstream & downstream speeds.  
- Use equations with time if necessary.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **15 problems**:

- 6–8 direct B/S from Up/Down speeds.  
- 4–6 round-trip time questions.  
- 2–3 where one of B/S is given and you find distance or time.

Be careful:
- Always mark Upstream and Downstream clearly.  
- Avoid mixing speeds.

### 4. Challenge Problems (15–20 min)

Solve **3–5 tougher questions**, patterns like:

1. A boat goes downstream to a point and returns upstream. The total distance is known, and total time is given. Find B or S.  
2. Two boats with different speeds travel in a river; find when/where they meet given current.

Spend **4 min** per question; think of them as relative speed problems adapted to water.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:
- Which is easier: problems with direct up/down speeds, or those requiring equations using times?  
- Short rule: “When they say ‘with the current’ think +S; ‘against’ think –S.”

## Day 6 – Mixed TSD Practice + Week 1–2 Micro-Revision

**Main goal:** Combine all TSD topics and keep older arithmetic fresh.

### 1. Quick Micro-Revision (20–25 min)

In your notebook (without looking initially):

- Write TSD core formula and unit conversions.  
- Write relative speed rules.  
- Write upstream/downstream formulas.  
- From earlier weeks, quickly jot:
  - % change formula  
  - Simple profit% and SI formula

Then check with notes and correct.

### 2. Mixed TSD Problem Set 1 – Untimed (35–40 min)

Solve **18–20 questions**:

- 4–5 basic TSD (speed/distance/time) and average speed.  
- 4–5 relative speed (pedestrians/vehicles).  
- 4–5 trains (poles, platforms, crossings).  
- 4–5 boats & streams.

Approach:
- For each question, **label type**: “TSD / Avg / Rel / Train / Boat”.  
- Be methodical: write knowns and unknown clearly.

### 3. Mixed TSD Problem Set 2 – Timed (25–30 min)

Now pick another **10–12 mixed questions** and set **25–30 min** timer.

- Aim: ~2–2.5 min per question on average.  
- If stuck beyond 3–3.5 min, skip, mark, and move on.

This simulates the pressure and helps you practice question selection.

### 4. Short Week 1–2 Refresh (15–20 min)

Solve **8–10 quick questions**:

- 3 from Percentages/Ratio/Average.  
- 3 from Profit & Loss.  
- 2–4 from SI/CI.

Don’t overthink; this is to avoid forgetting.

### 5. Error Analysis & Reflection (15–20 min)

Review today’s work:

- Identify 3 questions you got wrong or took too long on.  
- For each, write:
  - Type (e.g., “train vs man”, “boat round trip”)  
  - Main mistake reason (concept/formula/attention).  
  - A corrected, shorter method if any.

Note 1–2 micro-goals for tomorrow (e.g., “need 5 more average speed questions”, “practice 3 train + platform problems”).

---

## Day 7 – Week 3 Mini Mock + Consolidation

**Main goal:** Test yourself under exam-like conditions on Week 3 topics (with light integration).

### 1. Light Warm-up (10–15 min)

Solve 3–4 easy questions:

- 1 base TSD  
- 1 average speed  
- 1 trains  
- 1 boats & streams

Just to get into the groove.

### 2. Week 3 Mini Mock (45–50 min)

Prepare **25 questions**:

- **Basic TSD & Average Speed: 7 Q**  
  - 3 direct S/D/T  
  - 4 average speed (mix equal and unequal distances)
- **Relative Speed & Meeting: 5 Q**  
  - 2 same-direction, 3 opposite-direction
- **Trains: 7 Q**  
  - 2 train vs pole  
  - 2 train vs platform  
  - 3 train vs train/man (mix of same/opp. directions)
- **Boats & Streams: 6 Q**  
  - 3 direct up/down  
  - 3 with time/distance relations or round trips

Rules:
- Time limit: **45–50 min**, one uninterrupted sitting.  
- No checking answers until the end.  
- Use only basic tools allowed by your target exams (ideally no calculators).

Strategy:
- Start with your strongest area (say, basic TSD or trains).  
- Leave the hardest-looking questions for last.

### 3. Mock Analysis (35–45 min)

After the test:

1. Check answers and mark:
   - Correct, wrong, unattempted.

2. Compute:
   - Attempted count.  
   - Correct count.  
   - Accuracy = correct / attempted.

3. Break down wrong questions by category:
   - Conceptual mistake.  
   - Calculation error.  
   - Reading/interpretation issue.  
   - Time management issue.

4. For **every wrong or skipped question**:
   - Reattempt without looking at solution.  
   - Only then look at the solution.  
   - Immediately solve **1 similar problem** from your source if the concept was weak.

5. Create a “Week 3 Weak Spots” list, e.g.:
   - “Average speed when halves are by time, not distance.”  
   - “Train vs train in same direction.”  
   - “Boat round-trip time with equations.”

### 4. Weekly Reflection (10–15 min)

Answer in writing:

1. What are you now **confident** about in TSD?  
2. What still feels **slow or confusing**?  
3. How will you revise TSD in future weeks?  
   - Example: “10 min/day: 3 TSD mixed questions,” or  
   - “Every Sunday: 1 small TSD-only mock.”

4. Give yourself a score (1–10) for:
   - Understanding of TSD concepts.  
   - Speed & accuracy in TSD questions.

This closes Week 3 and prepares you for Week 4 (Time & Work, Number Systems) while keeping TSD concepts fresh.

---

If you’d like, I can next create a **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 4** (Time & Work + Number Systems) with the same structure and difficulty progression.
