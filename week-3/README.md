# 📚 WEEK 3: Time & Work, Pipes & Cisterns - Detailed Daily Plan

## 🗓️ **DAY 1 (Monday): Work & Efficiency Fundamentals**
**Total Time: 3 hours**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Basic Work & Efficiency Concepts**

**Core Principles:**
```
Fundamental Concepts:
- Work = Rate × Time
- Rate (Efficiency) = Work/Time
- If A completes work in n days:
  * A's 1 day work = 1/n
  * A's efficiency = 1/n units/day

Key Relations:
- More efficient = Less time
- Efficiency ∝ 1/Time
- If A is x times efficient as B:
  * Time_B = x × Time_A

Units Method:
- Total Work = LCM of all individual times
- This avoids fractions

Important Points:
- Always work with per day rates
- Combined efficiency = Sum of individual efficiencies
- Work done = Efficiency × Days worked
```

**Quick Reference Formulas:**
```
1. (A+B)'s 1 day work = A's 1 day + B's 1 day
2. If A does in x days, B in y days:
   Together = xy/(x+y) days
3. Efficiency ratio = Inverse of time ratio
4. Man-days = Men × Days = Constant
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 1 (Basic Work Concepts):**

1. A can complete work in 12 days. How much work in 5 days?
   - 1 day work = 1/12
   - 5 days work = 5/12
   - **Mental Math**: ~42% of work

2. A does 1/4 of work in 5 days. Total time needed?
   - 1/4 work → 5 days
   - Full work → 20 days
   - **Verification**: Rate = 1/20 per day ✓

3. A can do work in 10 days, B in 15 days. Together?
   - Method 1: 1/10 + 1/15 = 5/30 = 1/6
   - Together = 6 days
   - Method 2: LCM(10,15) = 30 units
   - A = 3 units/day, B = 2 units/day
   - Together = 5 units/day
   - Time = 30/5 = 6 days

4. If 5 men complete work in 20 days, how many days for 4 men?
   - Man-days = 5 × 20 = 100
   - 4 men need = 100/4 = 25 days
   - **Concept**: Inverse proportion

5. A is twice as efficient as B. Together finish in 18 days. Find individual times.
   - Let B = x units/day, A = 2x units/day
   - Combined = 3x units/day
   - Work = 18 × 3x = 54x units
   - A alone = 54x/2x = 27 days
   - B alone = 54x/x = 54 days

**Practice 10 more basic problems with increasing complexity**

### 🌆 **Evening Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **6:00 - 6:30 PM: LCM Method Mastery**
**Efficient Calculation Technique:**
```
Steps for LCM Method:

## 🗓️ **DAY 2 (Tuesday): Combined Work & Alternating Work**
**Total Time: 3 hours**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Together Working & Alternate Working**

**Combined Work Concepts:**
```
When Working Together:
- Add individual efficiencies
- Total rate = Σ(individual rates)
- Time = Work/Combined rate

When Working Alternately:
- Calculate work done in one cycle
- Find number of complete cycles
- Calculate remaining work
- Determine who completes it

Special Cases:
1. One person joins/leaves midway
2. Different working hours
3. Efficiency changes over time
4. Rest days in between
```

**Alternate Work Formula:**
```
If A and B work alternately (A starts):
- 2-day work = 1/a + 1/b
- Find complete cycles
- Check remaining work
- If <1/a, A finishes in partial day
- If >1/a, B works next day
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 2 (Combined & Alternate):**

1. A, B, C can do in 10, 12, 15 days. All start, C leaves after 2 days. Total time?
   - LCM = 60 units, Total work = 60
   - A=6, B=5, C=4 units/day
   - First 2 days: (6+5+4)×2 = 30 units
   - Remaining: 30 units by A+B = 30/11 days
   - Total = 2 + 30/11 = 4.73 days

2. A and B work alternately, A starting. A does in 20 days, B in 30 days. Total time?
   - 2-day cycle work = 1/20 + 1/30 = 1/12
   - 12 cycles = 24 days completes work
   - **Check**: After 11 cycles (22 days), work = 11/12
   - Remaining 1/12 done by A in 20/12 = 1.67 days
   - Total = 23.67 days

3. A works for 5 days, B completes remaining in 9 days. If B alone needs 15 days, find A's time.
   - B's 9 days work = 9/15 = 3/5
   - A's 5 days work = 2/5
   - A's full work time = 5 × 5/2 = 12.5 days

4. Three persons start together. After 4 days, one leaves. After 2 more days, another leaves. Last person completes in 7 more days. Individual times are 20, 30, 60 days. Find total work time.
   - Solution requires systematic approach
   - Total = 4 + 2 + 7 = 13 days

**Practice 10 more combined/alternate problems**

### 🌆 **Evening Session (1.5 hours)**

## 🗓️ **DAY 3 (Wednesday): Efficiency Ratios & Man-Days**
**Total Time: 3 hours**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Efficiency Ratios & Proportional Work**

**Key Concepts:**
```
Efficiency Ratios:
- Men : Women : Children = 3 : 2 : 1 (typical)
- Skilled : Semi-skilled : Unskilled
- Machine : Manual worker

Man-Days Concept:
- M₁ × D₁ = M₂ × D₂ (same work)
- M₁ × D₁ × H₁ = M₂ × D₂ × H₂ (with hours)
- M₁ × D₁ × H₁ × E₁ = M₂ × D₂ × H₂ × E₂ (with efficiency)

Chain Rule:
M₁/M₂ = (D₂/D₁) × (H₂/H₁) × (W₁/W₂) × (E₂/E₁)

Work Proportionality:
- Work ∝ Men × Days × Hours × Efficiency
- More work = More resources needed
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 3 (Ratios & Man-Days):**

1. If Men:Women:Children efficiency = 3:2:1, and 2M + 3W + 4C finish in 10 days. Find time for 3M + 2W + 3C.
   - Work units: 2(3) + 3(2) + 4(1) = 16 units/day
   - Total work = 16 × 10 = 160 units
   - New team: 3(3) + 2(2) + 3(1) = 16 units/day
   - Time = 160/16 = 10 days

2. 12 men complete wall in 15 days. How many men needed to complete in 9 days?
   - Man-days = 12 × 15 = 180
   - Men needed = 180/9 = 20 men

3. 15 men working 8 hrs/day complete in 21 days. How many days for 20 men working 6 hrs/day?
   - M₁D₁H₁ = M₂D₂H₂
   - 15 × 21 × 8 = 20 × D₂ × 6
   - D₂ = 2520/120 = 21 days

4. A work is 3 times larger than B work. 5 men do A work in 20 days working 8 hrs. How many men for B work in 5 days working 6 hrs?
   - Work ratio = 3:1
   - Apply chain rule with work factor
   - Answer: 5 men

5. Efficiency of A:B:C = 2:3:4. Working together they complete in 12 days. If A works at double efficiency, new time?
   - Original combined = 9 units/day
   - New: A=4, total = 11 units/day
   - New time = (9×12)/11 = 9.8 days

**Practice 10 more ratio-based problems**

## 🗓️ **DAY 4 (Thursday): Pipes & Cisterns Basics**
**Total Time: 3 hours**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Pipes & Cisterns Fundamentals**

**Core Concepts:**
```
Basic Principles:
- Inlet pipe = Positive work (fills)
- Outlet pipe = Negative work (empties)
- Net rate = Inlet rate - Outlet rate

Key Formulas:
- If pipe fills in x hours: Rate = 1/x per hour
- If pipe empties in y hours: Rate = -1/y per hour
- Combined rate = Σ(inlet rates) - Σ(outlet rates)

Special Cases:
1. Leak in tank (continuous outlet)
2. Multiple pipes with different capacities
3. Pipes opened/closed at intervals
4. Partial filling requirements

Conversion Note:
- All Time & Work concepts apply
- Replace "work" with "tank capacity"
- Efficiency = Filling/Emptying rate
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 4 (Basic Pipes):**

1. Pipe A fills in 6 hours, Pipe B fills in 8 hours. Together?
   - Combined rate = 1/6 + 1/8 = 7/24
   - Time = 24/7 = 3.43 hours

2. Inlet fills in 10 hrs, outlet empties in 15 hrs. Both open, time to fill?
   - Net rate = 1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30
   - Time = 30 hours

3. Tank filled by A in 4 hrs. Due to leak, takes 5 hrs. Leak alone empties in?
   - Without leak: 1/4 per hour
   - With leak: 1/5 per hour
   - Leak rate = 1/4 - 1/5 = 1/20
   - Leak empties in 20 hours

4. Three pipes A, B, C fill in 12, 15, 20 hrs. All opened. B closed after 2 hrs. Total time?
   - First 2 hrs: (1/12 + 1/15 + 1/20) × 2 = 1/3
   - Remaining 2/3 by A and C
   - Rate of A+C = 1/12 + 1/20 = 2/15
   - Time for remaining = (2/3)/(2/15) = 5 hrs
   - Total = 7 hours

5. Pipe A fills in 10 hrs, B empties in 15 hrs. Opened alternately starting with A. Time?
   - 2-hour cycle: 1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30
   - 30 cycles = 60 hours
