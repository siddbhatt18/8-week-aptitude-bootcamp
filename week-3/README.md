Here is the **Daily Plan for Week 3**.

**Theme:** **"The Rate of Work"**
**The 80/20 Insight:** The **LCM Method** (Day 1) is the core. If you master assuming "Total Work = LCM", you eliminate 90% of the confusing fractions ($1/x$) that slow students down.

---

### **Day 1: The LCM Method (Foundation)**
*Focus: Stop using fractions ($1/x$). Start using "Units" of work.*

*   **Concept Focus:**
    1.  Assume **Total Work** = LCM of the days given.
    2.  Calculate **Efficiency (Units/Day)** = Total Work / Days taken.
    3.  Time Taken = Total Work / Total Efficiency.
*   **Problem (Beginner):**
    *   "A takes 20 days, B takes 30 days. How long if they work together?"
    *   *The Old Way:* $1/20 + 1/30$... (Boring/Slow).
    *   *The LCM Way:* LCM(20, 30) = **60 Units** (Total Work).
        *   A's speed = $60/20 = 3$ units/day.
        *   B's speed = $60/30 = 2$ units/day.
        *   Together = $3+2 = 5$ units/day.
        *   Time = $60 / 5 = \textbf{12 days}$.

### **Day 2: Efficiency & Ratios**
*Focus: Connecting Week 2 (Ratios) with Time & Work.*

*   **Concept Focus:**
    *   Efficiency is **inversely proportional** to Time.
    *   If A is **twice** as good as B, A takes **half** the time.
    *   Ratio of Efficiency $A:B = 3:1 \rightarrow$ Ratio of Time $A:B = 1:3$.
*   **Problem (Intermediate - PYQ):**
    *   "A is 50% more efficient than B. B alone completes a task in 30 days. How long will they take together?"
    *   *Logic:* Efficiency ratio $A:B$. If B=100, A=150. Ratio $3:2$.
    *   Total Work = B's Efficiency $\times$ B's Time = $2 \times 30 = 60$ units.
    *   Combined Efficiency = $3 + 2 = 5$.
    *   Time = $60 / 5 = \textbf{12 days}$.

### **Day 3: Leaving & Joining (The "Timeline" Trick)**
*Focus: The most common placement question type.*

*   **Concept Focus:**
    1.  **Case 1 (Left after $x$ days):** Calculate work done, subtract from Total, distribute remainder.
    2.  **Case 2 (Left $x$ days *before* completion):** *The Super Shortcut* $\rightarrow$ Assume the person **didn't** leave. Add their hypothetical work to the Total Work, then divide by combined efficiency.
*   **Problem (The Shortcut):**
    *   "A (10 days) and B (15 days) start together. A leaves 2 days *before* completion. Calculate total time."
    *   *Setup:* LCM(10, 15) = 30. Eff: A=3, B=2.
    *   *Logic:* If A had stayed those last 2 days, he would have done $3 \times 2 = 6$ extra units.
    *   New Total Work = $30 + 6 = 36$.
    *   Total Time = $36 / (3+2) = 36/5 = \textbf{7.2 days}$.

### **Day 4: Alternate Days**
*Focus: Understanding "Cycles".*

*   **Concept Focus:** They don't work every day. They take turns.
    *   Calculate work done in **1 Cycle** (usually 2 days: A then B).
    *   Divide Total Work by Cycle Work to find full cycles.
    *   Handle the **Remainder** carefully (Who's turn is it next?).
*   **Problem (Tricky):**
    *   "A does a work in 10 days, B in 15 days. A starts, and they work on alternate days."
    *   *Setup:* Total=30. A=3, B=2.
    *   *Cycle:* Day 1 (A) + Day 2 (B) = $3+2 = 5$ units in **2 days**.
    *   *Math:* $30 / 5 = 6$ full cycles.
    *   *Time:* $6 \text{ cycles} \times 2 \text{ days/cycle} = \textbf{12 days}$.

### **Day 5: Pipes & Cisterns (Negative Efficiency)**
*Focus: Introduction of "The Leak".*

*   **Concept Focus:**
    *   Inlet Pipe = Positive Work (+).
    *   Outlet Pipe / Leak = Negative Work (-).
    *   Use the LCM method exactly as before, just subtract the leak's efficiency.
*   **Problem (PYQ):**
    *   "Pipe A fills in 10 hrs, Pipe B fills in 15 hrs, Pipe C empties in 30 hrs. All opened together."
    *   *LCM:* 30.
    *   *Eff:* A=+3, B=+2, C=**-1**.
    *   *Net Eff:* $3 + 2 - 1 = +4$.
    *   *Time:* $30 / 4 = \textbf{7.5 hrs}$.

### **Day 6: Group Work (Chain Rule / MDH)**
*Focus: Men, Women, and Wages.*

*   **Concept Focus:**
    *   **MDH Formula:** $\frac{M_1 \times D_1 \times H_1}{W_1} = \frac{M_2 \times D_2 \times H_2}{W_2}$
        *   M=Men, D=Days, H=Hours, W=Work (Output).
    *   **The "AND" vs "OR" Rule:**
        *   "3 Men OR 6 Boys" $\rightarrow$ Equate them ($1M = 2B$).
        *   "3 Men AND 6 Boys" $\rightarrow$ Add them.
*   **Problem (Classic):**
    *   "If 12 men can build a wall in 6 days, how many men are needed to build it in 4 days?"
    *   $12 \times 6 = M_2 \times 4 \rightarrow 72 = 4M_2 \rightarrow M_2 = 18$.

### **Day 7: Weekly Challenge & Accuracy Check**
*Focus: Handling complexity.*

1.  **Drill:** Go to a site like IndiaBix $\rightarrow$ "Time and Work". Solve 5 questions specifically involving "Efficiency percentages" and 5 "Pipes" questions.
2.  **Mock Scenario:**
    *   Try a problem where efficiency *changes* halfway through (e.g., "After 3 days, A's efficiency drops by 50%").
    *   *Hint:* Split the problem into Part 1 (Normal efficiency) and Part 2 (Reduced efficiency).
3.  **Self-Check:**
    *   Did you remember that "Outlet" means **Minus**?
    *   Did you confuse "Days taken" with "Efficiency"? (Remember: They are opposites).
