Here’s your **Week 3 (Day 1–7) plan**, focused on:

- Time, Speed & Distance (TSD)  
- Time & Work (including Pipes & Cisterns)  
- Applying Percentage/Ratio ideas to these

Assume ~1–1.5 hours/day. If you have more time, increase the number of practice questions.

Use any aptitude resource and filter by:
- “Time and Distance”
- “Time and Work”
- “Pipes and Cisterns”
- “Boats and Streams” (only basics this week, optional)

---

## Day 1 – Time, Speed & Distance: Core Basics

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- Core relationship:  
  - **Distance = Speed × Time**  
  - Time = Distance / Speed  
  - Speed = Distance / Time
- Units:
  - Common conversions:  
    - km/h to m/s: multiply by 5/18  
    - m/s to km/h: multiply by 18/5
- Uniform motion: speed constant → graph idea, but no need for formal graphs.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–35 min)
Target: **12–15 beginner questions**.

Problem types:
1. Simple D = S × T:
   - “A car travels 240 km in 4 hours. Find its speed.”
   - “A train moves at 60 km/h. How far in 3.5 hours?”
2. Basic T = D / S:
   - “How long to cover 150 km at 50 km/h?”
3. Unit conversion:
   - “Convert 54 km/h to m/s.”
   - “Convert 10 m/s to km/h.”
4. Simple word problems:
   - “A person walks at 5 km/h. How long for 12.5 km?”

**Reinforces**
- Comfort in switching between D, S, T.
- Comfortable and quick with km/h ↔ m/s.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 6–8 questions:
  - 4 TSD basics.
  - 2–4 very easy % or ratio from previous weeks (to keep them active).

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Note down:
  - Typical mistake: mixing hours and minutes (convert everything to hours or minutes).
  - Two examples where you needed to convert units and how you did it.

## Day 2 – Average Speed & Relative Speed (TSD)

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- **Average Speed**:
  - In general: total distance / total time.
  - Special case (equal distances, two speeds a and b):  
    Average speed = (2ab) / (a + b)
- **Relative Speed**:
  - Same direction: |S₁ – S₂|  
  - Opposite direction: S₁ + S₂  
- Applications: trains crossing each other, man walking along/against a train, etc.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 questions (easy→intermediate)**.

Problem types:
1. Average speed (general):
   - “A man travels 60 km at 30 km/h and 40 km at 20 km/h. Find average speed.”
2. Average speed (equal distances):
   - “Goes from A to B at 40 km/h, returns at 60 km/h. Average speed?”
3. Relative speed – opposite direction:
   - “Two trains of speeds 60 km/h and 40 km/h approach each other. If each is 200 m long, in how many seconds will they cross completely?”
4. Relative speed – same direction:
   - “Two trains of speeds 50 km/h and 30 km/h move in same direction. Faster overtakes slower in 18 seconds. If slower is 180 m long, find length of faster train.”

**Reinforces**
- Using formula total distance / total time correctly.
- Understanding when to use sum vs difference of speeds.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 4–5 TSD problems (mix of avg and relative speed).
- 2–3 simple % or ratio-based problems like “speed increased by 20%, what happens to time?”.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Write a small “cheat box”:
  - Avg speed equal distance formula.
  - Relative speeds (same vs opposite).
- Re-solve 2 questions that involved both km/h ↔ m/s and relative speed.

## Day 3 – Time & Work: Basic Concepts, Two-Person Problems

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- Work as a whole job = 1 unit.
- **Rate** of A = 1 / (time taken by A alone).
- Combined work:
  - If A alone in a days, B alone in b days → together:  
    Rate = 1/a + 1/b  
    Time together = 1 / (1/a + 1/b) = ab/(a+b)
- Relationship with ratios:
  - If A:B work rates = m:n, then their times are in ratio n:m.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 beginner→intermediate questions**.

Problem types:
1. Basic combined work:
   - “A can do a job in 10 days, B in 15 days. How long together?”
2. One leaves:
   - “A can do a work in 12 days, B in 18 days. They start together; B leaves after 4 days. In how many more days will A finish?”
3. Find individual from combined:
   - “A and B together can do a work in 8 days. A alone can do it in 12 days. How long will B alone take?”
4. Ratio of work:
   - “A and B together earn Rs. 360 for a piece of work. A alone can finish it in 12 days, B in 18. Find their shares.”

**Reinforces**
- Thinking in terms of “work per day”.
- Using combined rate and then individual rates.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 4–5 Time & Work questions (simple).
- 2–3 TSD basics from Days 1–2.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Note typical step:
  - “Step 1: find rate of A, B. Step 2: rate together. Step 3: time = 1 / rate.”
- Re-solve at least 1 problem with “B leaves after some days” carefully.

## Day 4 – Time & Work Variants + Pipes & Cisterns (Intro)

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
Part A – More Time & Work Patterns:
- 3-person problems (A,B,C).
- Workers entering/leaving at different times.

Part B – Pipes & Cisterns:
- Filling pipe: +rate; emptying pipe (leak): –rate.
- If pipe A fills in x hours → rate = 1/x tank/hour.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 questions (intermediate)**.

Problem types:
1. 3-person work:
   - “A can finish in 12 days, B in 15, C in 20. How long if all work together?”
2. Entry/exit:
   - “A and B can finish in 10 days. A alone can do it in 15 days. They work together for 5 days, then A leaves. In how many more days will B finish?”
3. Single pipe:
   - “Pipe A fills a tank in 6 hours. How much part is filled in 2 hours?”
4. Two fill, one empty:
   - “A fills in 6 h, B fills in 8 h, C empties in 12 h. If all open together, how long to fill empty tank?”

**Reinforces**
- Same “work-rate” logic applied to water tanks.
- Handling positive and negative rates.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 5–6 Time & Work / Pipes & Cisterns.
- 2–3 TSD problems.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Write a template for Pipes & Cisterns:
  - Step 1: Express each as fraction per hour.
  - Step 2: Sum with signs (+ for fill, – for empty).
  - Step 3: Time = 1 / net rate.
- Re-solve 1 complex 3-person work or pipe question.

## Day 5 – Boats and Streams (Optional) + TSD & Time–Work Combined Applications

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
Part A – Boats & Streams (if this topic shows up in your target exams; it often does):
- Still water speed = b, stream speed = s.
- Downstream speed = b + s.  
- Upstream speed = b – s.

Part B – Application with % and Ratios:
- Using rate-change → time-change:
  - If speed increases by p%, time decreases by p/(100+p).
- Using ratios for speeds and times:
  - Time ∝ 1/speed for fixed distance.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 questions**.

Problem types:
1. Boats & streams basic:
   - “Speed of boat in still water is 10 km/h, stream is 3 km/h. Find downstream and upstream speed.”
   - “Boat travels 30 km downstream in 2 hours. Find speed of stream if boat’s still water speed is 18 km/h.”
2. Speed–time–% relation:
   - “A man increases his speed by 20% and takes 10 min less for a same journey. Find original time.”
3. Ratio-based time/speed:
   - “Speeds of A and B are in ratio 3:4. Time taken for same distance will be in ratio?”

**Reinforces**
- Conversion of verbal statements into simple rate equations.
- Using percentages with speeds and times.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 3–4 boat/stream or TSD problems.
- 3–4 time & work / pipes problems.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Record:
  - One “speed–%–time” question and how you approached it.
- If boats & streams is less important for your target tests, focus more on rate/ratio problems.

## Day 6 – Consolidated Mixed Practice (TSD + Time & Work + Pipes)

### 1. Concepts (10–15 min)
- Quick recap:
  - D = S × T and T = D/S.
  - Work = Rate × Time; Rate = 1/time.
  - Pipes = work-rate problems with +/– rates.
  - Relative speed and average speed formulas.

### 2. Guided Mixed Set (30–40 min)
Target: **15–18 questions (easy→medium)**.

Try to create a balanced set:
- 5–6 TSD (including at least 1 relative speed, 1 average speed).
- 5–6 Time & Work.
- 3–4 Pipes & Cisterns.
- 1–2 boats/streams or speed–ratio problems.

Solve under light timing pressure:
- Aim: 15–18 questions in 30–35 minutes.

**Reinforces**
- Pattern recognition: quickly identifying if a question is TSD, Time & Work, or Pipe-type.
- Switching between D–S–T thinking and Work–Rate–Time thinking.

### 3. Focused Error Practice (15–20 min)
- Pick 3–4 questions you got wrong or found slow.
- Re-solve them **without** looking at the solution.
- For each, write:
  - “Type: (TSD/Work/Pipe)”  
  - “Main formula used:”  
  - “Where I went wrong / why slow?”

### 4. Short Review (10–15 min)
- Make a one-page consolidation:
  - D–S–T formula and unit conversions.
  - Relative speed rules.
  - Work-rate formula and 2-person, 3-person templates.
  - Pipes & Cisterns net rate approach.

## Day 7 – Week 3 Mini Mock + Revision

### 1. Timed Mini Mock (35–40 min)
Create a small mock of **20–25 questions** focusing on Week 3 topics:

- 8–10 TSD questions (include:
  - 2–3 simple,
  - 2 average speed,
  - 2 relative speed,
  - 1–2 boats/streams or %–speed).
- 8–10 Time & Work / Pipes & Cisterns questions.
- 2–4 small mix from Week 1–2 (percentages/ratios) that feed into TSD/Work.

Try to mirror real test:
- 35–40 minutes, no interruptions.
- First pass: quickly solve all easy ones.
- Second pass: pick the medium/hard ones you marked.

### 2. Mock Review (30–40 min)
For each wrong/guessed/skipped question:
- Tag the issue:
  1. **Concept gap** (didn’t know how to start).
  2. **Misread / incorrect setup**.
  3. **Calculation or time pressure**.
- For (1): revisit concept and solve 1–2 more of that type.
- For (2): rewrite the question in your own words and set up equations cleanly.
- For (3): see if you could have used a simpler ratio/shortcut instead of long arithmetic.

### 3. Final Week 3 Summary Sheet (15–20 min)
On one sheet/page, write:

- TSD:
  - D = S × T, conversions (km/h↔m/s).
  - Avg speed formula (general + equal distances).
  - Relative speed rules.
- Time & Work:
  - Rate = 1/time, combined rate formulas.
  - Splitting earnings based on work done.
- Pipes & Cisterns:
  - Rate per hour, net rate with +/– signs.

Keep this sheet handy for quick revision before mocks in later weeks.
