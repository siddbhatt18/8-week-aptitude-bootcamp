## Day 1 – Averages: Basics & Direct Problems

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Definition of Average**  
- Average = (Sum of values) / (Number of values)  
- Sum = Average × Number of values.

b) **Simple Situations**
- Equal weights (simple numbers).  
- Rearranging formula quickly:  
  - If average and count known → get total sum.  
  - If sum & count known → get average.

c) **Typical Aptitude Uses**
- Set of numbers, marks, ages, runs scored.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

Use any aptitude book / online platform; focus on these types.

**Beginner**
1. Find average of:  
   - 5, 7, 8, 10  
   - 10, 20, 30, 40, 50  

2. If the average of 6 numbers is 15, find the sum.  
3. The sum of 8 observations is 200. What is the average?

**Intermediate**
4. The average of 5 numbers is 18. One of them is 22. What is the average of the remaining 4 numbers?  
5. A batsman scored 30, 45, 55, 60, 70 runs in 5 innings. Find his average score.  
6. The average age of 4 people is 25 years. A fifth person joins, and the average becomes 24 years. Find the age of the fifth person.

**Reinforces**
- Direct use of average formula  
- Moving between sum ↔ average ↔ count  
- Understanding “effect of adding a number”

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 quick questions where you:  
  - Are given average & count → find sum.  
  - Are given sum & count → find average.  
- Aim to finish in 10–12 minutes.

### 4. Reflection (5–10 min)

- Note what you found tricky: reading the question, arithmetic, or formula?

## Day 2 – Averages: Replacement & Groups

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Changing Average When One Value Is Replaced/Added/Removed**
- If one item is added:  
  - New sum = old sum + new value  
  - New average = new sum / new count  
- Similarly for removed/replaced items.

b) **Average of Group vs Subgroup**
- Total sum = (avg of group × number of items).  
- Use this to combine / separate groups (e.g., boys & girls).

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**
1. The average of 10 numbers is 20. If one more number 30 is added, what is the new average?  
2. The average of 8 numbers is 15. One number 19 is removed. What is the new average?  

**Intermediate**
3. The average weight of 5 men is 60 kg. Another person joins, and the average becomes 58 kg. Find the weight of the new person.  
4. The average of 20 students is 50 marks. One student scored 80 marks instead of the correct 60 marks. What is the correct average?  
5. The average age of 30 students is 15 years. If the teacher’s age is included, the average becomes 16 years. What is the teacher’s age?

**Advanced (1–2 problems)**
6. The average age of a family of 5 members is 25 years. A baby is born, and the average drops to 22 years. What is the age of the baby?  

7. Average marks of boys in a class is 70, of girls is 80. Overall average is 76. If number of girls is 20, find number of boys.  
   - Set up:  
     - Total marks = 70B + 80×20  
     - Count = B + 20  
     - Overall average = 76

**Reinforces**
- Sum-based thinking for averages  
- Handling errors, replacement problems  
- Group average problems

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

## Day 3 – Profit & Loss: Basics

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Key Terms**
- Cost Price (CP): buying price  
- Selling Price (SP): selling price  
- Profit = SP – CP (SP > CP)  
- Loss = CP – SP (SP < CP)

b) **Formulas**
- Profit% = (Profit / CP) × 100  
- Loss% = (Loss / CP) × 100  
- SP = CP × (1 + Profit% / 100)  
- SP = CP × (1 – Loss% / 100)  
- CP = SP / (1 + Profit% / 100) or SP / (1 – Loss% / 100)

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**
1. CP = ₹200, SP = ₹250. Find profit and profit %.  
2. CP = ₹500, SP = ₹450. Find loss and loss %.  
3. Item bought for ₹800 is sold at 10% profit. Find SP.  
4. Item bought for ₹600 is sold at 20% loss. Find SP.

**Intermediate**
5. An article is sold for ₹720 at 20% profit. Find the cost price.  
6. An article is sold for ₹480 at 25% loss. Find CP.  
7. A trader buys an item for ₹500 and wants 30% profit. What should be the SP?

**Advanced (1–2 problems)**
8. A man bought an article at 20% discount on the marked price and sold it at the marked price. Find his profit %.  
   - Let MP = 100, CP = 80, SP = 100, then compute profit%.

**Reinforces**
- Using CP as base for %  
- Direct and reverse profit/loss calculations  
- Comfort with CP, SP, MP

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 10 quick CP–SP–profit/loss % conversions, like:
  - “CP=400, profit=15%; SP=?”  
  - “SP=460, loss=8%; CP=?”  
- Aim for 12–15 minutes.

### 4. Short Reflection (5–10 min)

- Write formula set in notebook and a 2–3 line explanation for each.  
- Note if you confuse CP vs SP in % formula.

---

## Day 4 – Discount, Marked Price & Combined P&L

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Key Terms**
- Marked Price (MP): price printed on tag.  
- Discount% = (Discount / MP) × 100  
- Selling Price (SP) = MP – Discount.  
- If MP is x% above CP, and discount y% on MP, net result may be profit or loss.

b) **Successive Changes (Light Intro)**
- If price up by a%, then down by b% on new price, use compound effect:  
  - Net factor = (1 + a/100) × (1 – b/100)  

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**
1. MP = ₹1000, discount = 10%. Find SP.  
2. MP = ₹1500, discount = 20%. Find SP and discount amount.

**Intermediate**
3. A shopkeeper marks goods at 40% above CP and allows 10% discount on MP. Find profit %.  
   - Let CP = 100. Then MP = 140; SP = 140 × 0.9 = 126; profit = 26%.  
4. A product costs the shopkeeper ₹500. He marks it 20% above CP and gives 10% discount. What is SP and profit %?

5. An article is sold at ₹540 giving 10% discount on the marked price. Find marked price.

**Advanced (1–2 problems)**
6. A trader marks his goods 50% above CP but allows two successive discounts of 10% and 20%. Find his profit or loss %.  
   - Use factor: CP=100 → MP=150 → SP = 150×(0.9)×(0.8).

**Reinforces**
- Working with MP, discount, SP together  
- Thinking with assumed CP/MP = 100 for simplification  
- Understanding how successive % affect final price

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 6–8 questions mixing:  
  - Single discount  
  - MP above CP + discount  
  - Reverse finding MP from SP & discount  
- Target: 15 minutes.

### 4. Quick Recap (5–10 min)

- Make a small table of:  
  - Given → Find (e.g., Given CP & profit% → find SP; Given SP & discount% → find MP).  
- This will help in faster recognition of question type in exams.

## Day 5 – Simple Interest: Basics & Direct Questions

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Simple Interest (SI)**  
- SI = (P × R × T) / 100  
  - P = Principal (initial amount)  
  - R = Rate % per annum  
  - T = Time in years  

b) **Amount (A)**  
- A = P + SI

c) **Unit Consistency**
- T is usually in years; if in months, convert to years (e.g., 6 months = 0.5 years).  

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**
1. Find SI on ₹1000 at 10% per annum for 2 years.  
2. Find SI on ₹5000 at 5% per annum for 3 years.  
3. A sum amounts to ₹1200 in 3 years at simple interest at 10% p.a. Find the principal.  
   - Use SI = (P×R×T)/100, then A = P + SI.

**Intermediate**
4. On a certain sum, SI in 2 years is ₹240 at 12% p.a. Find the principal.  
5. A sum becomes ₹720 in 4 years and ₹780 in 5 years at SI. Find the principal and the rate.
