# 📚 WEEK 2: Percentages, Profit & Loss, Discounts - Detailed Daily Plan

## 🗓️ **DAY 1 (Monday): Percentage Fundamentals**
**Total Time: 3 hours**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Basic Percentage Concepts & Conversions**

**Essential Conversions to Memorize:**
```
Fractions to Percentages:
1/2 = 50%       1/3 = 33.33%     1/4 = 25%
1/5 = 20%       1/6 = 16.67%     1/7 = 14.28%
1/8 = 12.5%     1/9 = 11.11%     1/10 = 10%
1/11 = 9.09%    1/12 = 8.33%     1/13 = 7.69%

Key Percentages:
16⅔% = 1/6      33⅓% = 1/3      66⅔% = 2/3
12½% = 1/8      37½% = 3/8      62½% = 5/8
```

**Core Formulas:**
```
- Percentage = (Part/Whole) × 100
- Increase% = (Increase/Original) × 100
- Decrease% = (Decrease/Original) × 100
- Value after x% increase = Original × (1 + x/100)
- Value after x% decrease = Original × (1 - x/100)
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 1 (Basic Percentages):**

1. What is 35% of 280?
   - Method 1: 0.35 × 280 = 98
   - Method 2: 35% = 30% + 5% = 84 + 14 = 98
   - **Speed trick**: 10% = 28, so 35% = 3.5 × 28 = 98

2. If 40% of a number is 120, find the number
   - 0.4x = 120
   - x = 300
   - **Verification**: 40% of 300 = 120 ✓

3. A number increased from 80 to 100. Find percentage increase
   - Increase = 20
   - Percentage = (20/80) × 100 = 25%
   - **Quick method**: 80 → 100 means ×1.25 = 25% increase

4. 75 is what percent of 300?
   - (75/300) × 100 = 25%
   - **Mental math**: 75/300 = 1/4 = 25%

5. After 20% discount, price is ₹800. Find original price
   - 80% = ₹800
   - 100% = 800/0.8 = ₹1000

**Practice 10 more similar problems with increasing complexity**

### 🌆 **Evening Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **6:00 - 6:30 PM: Speed Calculation Techniques**
**Mental Math Shortcuts:**
```
Finding 1% = Divide by 100 (move decimal 2 places)
Finding 10% = Divide by 10 (move decimal 1 place)
Finding 5% = Half of 10%
Finding 15% = 10% + 5%
Finding 25% = Divide by 4
Finding 50% = Divide by 2
Finding 75% = 50% + 25%
```

## 🗓️ **DAY 2 (Tuesday): Successive Percentage Changes**
**Total Time: 3 hours**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Multiple & Successive Percentage Changes**

**Key Formulas:**
```
Successive Changes:
- Two changes a% and b%:
  Net = a + b + (ab/100)%
  
- Three changes a%, b%, c%:
  Net = Use multiplier method
  
Multiplier Method:
- x% increase → multiply by (1 + x/100)
- x% decrease → multiply by (1 - x/100)

Special Cases:
- Same % increase then decrease: Net = -(x²/100)%
- n times x% increase: Final = Initial × (1 + x/100)ⁿ
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 2 (Successive Changes):**

1. Price increased by 20%, then decreased by 20%. Net change?
   - Method 1: Formula = 20 - 20 - (20×20/100) = -4%
   - Method 2: 100 → 120 → 96, Net = -4%
   - **Key insight**: Not zero!

2. Salary increased by 10%, 20%, and 15% successively. Total increase?
   - Multipliers: 1.1 × 1.2 × 1.15 = 1.518
   - Total increase = 51.8%

3. Population decreases by 10% annually. After 3 years?
   - Multiplier = 0.9³ = 0.729
   - Net decrease = 27.1%

4. Two successive discounts of 20% and 15%. Single equivalent discount?
   - Net = 20 + 15 - (20×15/100) = 32%
   - **Verification**: 100 → 80 → 68, Discount = 32%

5. If 30% increase followed by x% decrease results in no change, find x
   - 1.3 × (1 - x/100) = 1
   - x = 23.08%

**Practice 10 more complex successive change problems**

## 🗓️ **DAY 3 (Wednesday): Profit & Loss Basics**
**Total Time: 3 hours**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Fundamental P&L Concepts**

**Core Terminology & Formulas:**
```
Basic Terms:
- CP = Cost Price (buying price)
- SP = Selling Price (selling price)
- Profit = SP - CP (when SP > CP)
- Loss = CP - SP (when CP > SP)

Percentage Formulas:
- Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100
- Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100
- SP = CP × (1 + Profit%/100)
- SP = CP × (1 - Loss%/100)
- CP = SP × 100/(100 + Profit%)
- CP = SP × 100/(100 - Loss%)

Quick Relations:
- 25% profit means SP = 1.25 × CP
- 20% loss means SP = 0.80 × CP
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 3 (Basic P&L):**

1. CP = ₹500, Profit = 20%. Find SP
   - SP = 500 × 1.2 = ₹600
   - **Check**: Profit = 100, 100/500 = 20% ✓

2. SP = ₹1,200, Loss = 20%. Find CP
   - 80% of CP = 1200
   - CP = 1200 × 100/80 = ₹1,500

3. Bought for ₹800, sold for ₹1,000. Profit%?
   - Profit = 200
   - Profit% = 200/800 × 100 = 25%

4. If profit% = 25%, and profit = ₹150, find SP
   - 25% of CP = 150
   - CP = 600
   - SP = 750

5. Two items sold at ₹990 each. One at 10% profit, other at 10% loss. Net?
   - CP₁ = 990 × 100/110 = 900
   - CP₂ = 990 × 100/90 = 1100
   - Total CP = 2000, Total SP = 1980
   - Loss = ₹20

**Practice 12 more problems covering all scenarios**

### 🌆 **Evening Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **6:00 - 6:30 PM: Special Cases**
**Important Patterns:**
```
1. Same SP, one profit%, one loss% → Always net loss
   Loss% = (common rate)²/100

2. Selling at CP but using false weight:
   Profit% = (Error/(True - Error)) × 100

3. x% profit on CP = y% profit on SP:
   Relation: x = y/(1 - y/100)
```

#### **6:30 - 7:30 PM: Application Practice**

**Mixed Problems Set:**
1. Shopkeeper sells at CP but uses 900g weight for 1kg. Profit%?

## 🗓️ **DAY 4 (Thursday): Marked Price & Discounts**
**Total Time: 3 hours**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: MP, Discounts, and their Relations**

**Key Concepts & Formulas:**
```
Terms:
- MP = Marked Price (Label price)
- Discount = MP - SP
- Discount% = (Discount/MP) × 100

Relations:
- SP = MP × (1 - Discount%/100)
- MP = CP × (1 + Markup%/100)
- Profit% = [(MP × (1 - D%/100))/CP - 1] × 100

Chain of prices:
CP → (+Markup%) → MP → (-Discount%) → SP

Successive Discounts:
- Two discounts d₁% and d₂%:
  Net = d₁ + d₂ - (d₁×d₂/100)%
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 4 (MP & Discounts):**

1. MP = ₹2,000, Discount = 20%, Find SP
   - SP = 2000 × 0.8 = ₹1,600

2. Markup = 40% above CP, Discount = 20%. Net profit%?
   - Let CP = 100
   - MP = 140
   - SP = 140 × 0.8 = 112
   - Profit% = 12%

3. After 25% discount, customer pays ₹750. Find MP
   - 75% of MP = 750
   - MP = ₹1,000

4. Two discounts: 20% and 15%. Single equivalent?
   - Net = 20 + 15 - 3 = 32%
   - **Quick check**: 100 → 80 → 68

5. MP is 60% above CP. What discount% gives 20% profit?
   - CP = 100, MP = 160
   - For 20% profit, SP = 120
   - Discount = 40/160 = 25%

**Practice 10 more complex markup-discount problems**

### 🌆 **Evening Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **6:00 - 7:30 PM: Advanced Integration**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Dishonest Shopkeeper Problems**

**Types of Dishonesty:**
```
1. False Weights:
   Profit% = (True - False)/False × 100

2. Mixture Adulteration:
   Profit% = Adulterant%/(100 - Adulterant%) × 100

3. Multiple Dishonesty:
   - False weight + Markup
   - Use multiplier method

4. Meter/Scale Tampering:
   - Cloth merchant using 90cm scale
   - Profit% = Error/Actual × 100

Special Formula:
If claims x% profit but uses false weight:
Net Profit% = [(1 + x/100) × True/False - 1] × 100
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 5 (Dishonest Dealings):**

1. Shopkeeper uses 800g weight for 1kg, sells at CP. Profit%?
   - Profit% = 200/800 × 100 = 25%

2. Dealer uses 900g for 1kg buying, 900g for 1kg selling. Profit%?
   - Buying 900g at rate of 1000g
   - Selling 900g at rate of 900g
   - Profit% = (1000/900 - 1) × 100 = 11.11%

3. Milkman adds 20% water, sells at CP. Profit%?
   - In 120L mixture, 100L milk
   - Cost of 100L, selling 120L
   - Profit% = 20%

4. Shopkeeper gives 20% less, charges 20% more. Net gain%?
   - Multiplier = 1.2 × 1.25 = 1.5
   - Profit = 50%

5. Uses 90cm scale as meter, 10% markup. Total profit%?
   - False measure profit = 10/90 × 100 = 11.11%
