Below is a **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 2**, focused on:

- **Profit & Loss**
- **Simple Interest (SI) & Compound Interest (CI)**
- Light revision of Week 1 topics (Percentages, Ratios, Averages)

Assume ~**2.5–3 hours/day**. Adjust question counts if your available time differs. The structure always follows:

> Learn → See guided examples → Attempt on your own → Timed practice → Reflect.

## Day 1 – Profit & Loss: Core Basics

**Main goal:** Understand CP, SP, profit, loss, and basic formulas clearly enough to solve simple questions.

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

Study and write in your notebook:

1. **Definitions**
   - Cost Price (CP): Buying price.
   - Selling Price (SP): Selling price.
   - Profit: SP – CP (when SP > CP).
   - Loss: CP – SP (when SP < CP).

2. **Formulas**
   - Profit% = `(Profit / CP) × 100`
   - Loss% = `(Loss / CP) × 100`
   - SP in terms of CP:
     - If profit% = p: `SP = CP × (1 + p/100)`
     - If loss% = l: `SP = CP × (1 – l/100)`
   - CP in terms of SP:
     - `CP = SP / (1 + p/100)` for profit.
     - `CP = SP / (1 – l/100)` for loss.

3. **Multiplier approach** (very important later):
   - CP = 100, Profit 20% → SP = 120 (ratio SP:CP = 6:5).
   - This “assume CP = 100” trick often simplifies problems.

### 2. Guided Examples (15–20 min)

Work through 6–8 examples:

1. CP = ₹500, SP = ₹575. Find profit and profit%.  
2. CP = ₹800, loss = 10%. Find SP.  
3. SP = ₹660, profit = 10%. Find CP.  
4. CP = ₹400, SP = ₹340. Loss%?  
5. A trader buys a pen for ₹40 and sells for ₹50. Gain%?

Write:
- Which formula you chose.
- Values substituted.
- Brief mental check: “Is % plausible?”

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner (35–45 min)

Solve **15–20 problems** from any aptitude source/PYQs:

- 8–10 direct profit/loss questions (CP & SP given; find % or vice-versa).
- 5–7 where you must:
  - Find CP from given SP & profit%/loss%.
  - Find SP from CP & profit%/loss%.

Self-rules:
- Max **2.5 minutes** per question.
- If stuck: write what you know as equations, then move on. Mark the question.

### 4. Short Speed Drill (10–15 min)

Make a list:

- Assume CP = 100 for items.
- For profit% = 5, 10, 12.5, 20, 25, 30, 50, quickly compute SP (multipliers: 1.05, 1.1, 1.125, 1.2, etc.).
- For loss% = 5, 10, 20, 25, compute SP (multipliers: 0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.75).

Time aim: finish in **10–12 minutes**.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:
- Which formula feels 100% clear?
- Are you comfortable using multipliers like 1.2, 0.85 instead of re-deriving?

---

## Day 2 – Profit & Loss with Discount & Marked Price

**Main goal:** Handle MP (Marked Price), SP, CP, Discount, and combined scenarios.

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

Learn and note:

1. **Marked Price (MP)**: Price printed on the tag.  
2. **Discount**:
   - Discount = MP – SP  
   - Discount% = `(Discount / MP) × 100`
3. Combined view:
   - Sequence: CP → (markup) → MP → (discount) → SP.
4. Using multipliers:
   - Markup 20% on CP → MP = CP × 1.2  
   - Discount 10% on MP → SP = MP × 0.9  
   - Overall: `SP = CP × 1.2 × 0.9`

### 2. Guided Examples (20 min)

Solve 6–8 examples:

1. A shopkeeper marks an item at ₹1000 and gives 20% discount. Find SP and discount.  
2. MP = ₹800, SP = ₹680. Find discount%.  
3. CP = ₹600, profit = 25%. Find SP.  
4. CP = ₹800, marked up by 50%, then 20% discount. Find SP and overall profit%.  
5. A trader gives 10% discount on MP but still gains 8%. If CP = 100, find MP using multiplier logic.

Think in terms of:
- Step-wise multipliers (e.g., CP → 1.5CP → after discount 1.5×0.8CP, etc.).
- Whether overall effect is gain or loss.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (40–50 min)

Solve **15–20 problems** that include:

- Pure discount (MP, discount% → SP).
- MP, SP given → find discount%.
- CP, discount%, profit% given → find MP or SP.
- Chain scenarios like:
  - “Marked 40% above CP, gave 20% discount, what is profit%?”

Try to **convert everything into multiplier form** instead of using isolated formulas.

### 4. Challenge Problems – Advanced (15–20 min)

Select **3–5 tougher PYQ-style** problems (don’t peek at solution quickly):

Patterns to look for:

1. “A sells a product at 20% profit. If he had bought it at 10% less and sold at ₹10 more, his profit would be 30%. Find CP.”  
2. “A shopkeeper allows 10% discount and still gains 20%. If cost is ₹C, find MP in terms of C and then calculate for some given C.”

Give yourself **4–5 minutes** per problem. Try multiple approaches if stuck (algebra vs multipliers).

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Note:
- Are you comfortable thinking CP = 100, then building up to MP and SP?  
- Which kind of question took longest: discount%, reverse calculation (finding MP/CP), or chained discounts/markups?

---

## Day 3 – Simple Interest (SI): Fundamentals

**Main goal:** Understand SI clearly and solve straightforward and then slightly tricky SI problems.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Define and note:

1. **Simple Interest (SI)**:
   - `SI = (P × R × T) / 100`
   - P = Principal (initial amount)
   - R = Rate per annum (%)
   - T = Time (years)
2. **Amount (A)**:
   - `A = P + SI`
3. If SI and some variables are given, you can back-calc the missing one (P or R or T).

### 2. Guided Examples (15–20 min)

Solve ~8 examples:

1. Find SI on ₹5000 at 10% p.a. for 2 years.  
2. P = ₹8000, R = 12%, T = 3 years. Find SI and A.  
3. SI is ₹600 on P at 10% for 3 years. Find P.  
4. SI on a sum for 4 years at 5% is ₹200. Find P.  
5. A sum amounts to ₹660 in 3 years at 8% SI. Find P.

Focus on:
- Rearranging formula to find unknowns.  
- Checking units: R in % per year, T in years.

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner to Intermediate (40–45 min)

Solve **15–20 SI questions**:

- 7–9: Direct SI & Amount.  
- 5–7: Back-calculation (find P, R, or T).  
- 3–4: Simple real-life word problems (loans, deposits, etc.).

Try to spot patterns:
- How doubling time or rate affects SI.  
- That SI is linear: double time → double SI.

### 4. Mini Conceptual Challenge (15 min)

Try to answer in your notebook (without formal “questions”):

1. If you invest ₹1000 at 10% SI for 1, 2, 3, 4 years, what are SIs each year? What pattern do you see?  
2. Compare two investments:
   - A: ₹2000 at 5% for 3 years.  
   - B: ₹1500 at 8% for 3 years.  
   Which gives higher SI? By how much?

This builds intuitive understanding, not just formula use.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:
- Which type of SI problem is easier: direct or reverse (finding P/R/T)?  
- Any consistent algebraic mistake when rearranging formula?

---

## Day 4 – Compound Interest (CI) & SI vs CI

**Main goal:** Learn CI basics, yearly compounding, and compare SI vs CI.

### 1. Concept Learning (30–35 min)

Note:

1. **Compound Interest (CI)** (annual compounding):
   - `A = P (1 + R/100)^T`
   - `CI = A – P`
2. For T = 2, 3, you can expand:
   - 2 years: `A = P (1 + R/100)^2`  
   - 3 years: `A = P (1 + R/100)^3`
3. Difference between SI & CI:
   - SI: interest calculated on **original principal**.  
   - CI: interest calculated on **principal + previous interest** (interest on interest).

### 2. Guided Examples (20 min)

Solve ~8 examples:

1. Find CI on ₹5000 at 10% p.a. for 2 years.  
2. Find CI on ₹8000 at 12% p.a. for 3 years.  
3. P = ₹4000, R = 10%, T = 2 years. Find both SI and CI; compare.  
4. Difference between CI and SI on ₹P for 2 years at 10% is ₹40. Find P.  
5. For small T and R, approximate: CI – SI is small; verify for R=5%, T=2.

Write:
- Step-by-step calculation of multipliers.  
- Patterns observed (CI > SI when T>1, R>0).

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (40–45 min)

Solve **12–15 CI problems**:

- 6–8: Straight CI (2–3 years, annual compounding).  
- 3–4: Compare SI and CI on same P, R, T.  
- 3–4: Word problems: “The amount becomes ₹X in 2 years at CI. Find P or R.”

For each:
- Try to keep intermediate calculations neat to avoid arithmetic errors.
- Use fraction forms for some rates (e.g., 10% → 1.1, 20% → 1.2, etc.)

### 4. Challenge Problems (15–20 min)

Select **3–5 problems** with “difference between SI and CI” or “rates/time to double”:

Examples to look for:

1. “At what rate will a sum double in 3 years at CI?”  
2. “The CI on a certain sum for 2 years at 10% is ₹210. What is the SI for the same?”  
3. “The difference between SI and CI on ₹5000 for 2 years is ₹10. Find R.”

Spend up to **4 minutes** each. Don’t look at solution until you’ve tried an approach; write your attempt even if incomplete.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Note:
- Which felt more natural now: SI formula or CI formula?  
- Are you handling small exponents (like `(1.1)^2`, `(1.2)^3`) comfortably?

## Day 5 – Mixed Money Math: P&L + SI/CI + Week 1 Revision

**Main goal:** Integrate concepts and test basic multi-step reasoning.

### 1. Quick Revision (20–25 min)

From memory, write:

- P&L formulas (profit%, loss%, discount%, relations among CP, SP, MP).  
- SI formula and rearrangements.  
- CI formula for yearly compounding.  
- Week 1: % change, ratio division, average formula.

Check against your notes and correct.

### 2. Mixed Problem Set 1 – Untimed (35–40 min)

Solve **15–20 mixed questions**:

- 5–7 P&L (at least 2 with discount/MP).  
- 5–7 SI & CI (some comparison).  
- 4–6 from Week 1 topics (percentages/ratios/averages).

Approach:
- FIRST identify type: mark each question with “P&L / SI / CI / % / R / Avg”.  
- Then solve.

This classification habit will help you choose a strategy quickly in real exams.

### 3. Mixed Problem Set 2 – Timed (25–30 min)

Take another **10–12 questions** and set **25–30 min** timer.

- Aim for **2 min average** per question.
- If stuck beyond 3 min: leave, circle, and move on.

Afterwards, mark:
- Questions that took too long.  
- Questions you got wrong.

### 4. Error Analysis (20–25 min)

For each wrong/slow question:

1. Identify the *primary* reason:
   - Concept gap  
   - Formula confusion  
   - Arithmetic error  
   - Misreading

2. Re-solve correctly, step by step.  
3. If it’s a *type* of question (like reverse P&L, or SI back-calculation), note: “Need 5 more questions of this type tomorrow.”

### 5. Reflection (5–10 min)

Write:
- Two things you did well (e.g., “did not get stuck too long,” “used multipliers often”).  
- One thing to improve tomorrow.

---

## Day 6 – Higher-level P&L & SI/CI Applications

**Main goal:** Work with trickier/combined patterns and build stamina.

### 1. Concept Review (15–20 min)

Revisit:

- Profit & loss with fake weights or multiple transactions in chain (A sells to B, B to C…).  
- P&L with discount + profit still present (e.g., “After a 10% discount, still 20% profit”).  
- SI/CI reverse problems.

You don’t need to study from scratch, just recall patterns and maybe re-solve 2–3 representative examples.

### 2. Advanced P&L Problems (35–40 min)

Solve **10–12 harder P&L problems**, such as:

- False weights:
  - “A uses 900 g weights but sells as 1 kg at CP. Find profit%.”  
- Chain profits:
  - “A sells to B at 20% profit, B sells to C at 25% profit. C pays ₹900. Find A’s cost price.”
- MP/discount + profit conditions:
  - “After 20% discount on MP, a trader still makes 25% profit. Find MP if CP known.”

Challenge yourself:
- Set **max 4 minutes** per question.  
- Try using CP = 100 when profits and discounts are % based.

### 3. SI/CI Mixed Applications (30–35 min)

Solve **8–10 problems** that include:

- Comparing two investments (different P, R, T).  
- Choosing better investment option (SI vs CI).  
- Calculating unknown variable from difference between SI and CI.

Example pattern to search for:
- “At what rate % will ₹X amount yield same interest in 3 years under SI as ₹Y in 2 years?”  
- “A sum amounts to P1 with SI and P2 with CI for same time & rate; find something unknown.”

### 4. Short Timed Drill (15–20 min)

Make a mini-set of **6–8 problems**:
- 3 P&L
- 3 SI/CI
- 1–2 %/ratio

Set a **15–18 min** timer and solve.

Goal:
- Sustain focus and quick switching between topics.  
- Observe if you’re losing more time at the start (warm-up) or toward the end (fatigue).

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Answer:
- Which “pattern type” feels slowest? (false weights, chain profits, CI reverse, etc.)  
- Decide one micro-goal for tomorrow:  
  - e.g., “Do 5 extra false-weight P&L questions,” or “Practice 5 CI vs SI difference questions.”

---

## Day 7 – Week 2 Mini Mock + Consolidation

**Main goal:** Simulate an exam-like section focused on Week 2 topics, with some Week 1 integration.

### 1. Light Warm-up (15–20 min)

Solve 3–4 easy questions:

- 1 plain P&L
- 1 SI
- 1 CI
- 1 simple % or average

Just to “warm up” and get into calculation mode.

### 2. Week 2 Mini Mock (45–50 min)

Prepare/choose **25 questions**:

- **P&L (10 Q total)**  
  - 4–5 basic (profit%, loss%)  
  - 3–4 with discount/MP  
  - 1–2 with chain transactions / false weights type
- **SI & CI (10 Q total)**  
  - 5 SI (some reverse)  
  - 5 CI (2–3 compare with SI or reverse problems)
- **Week 1 revision (5 Q total)**  
  - Mix of percentages, ratios, averages.

Rules:

- Time limit: **45–50 minutes**, one sitting, no checking solutions mid-way.  
- Use only pen, paper, and a basic (or no) calculator depending on target exam rules. If your exams don’t allow calculators, don’t use one now.

Try to:
- Start with your strongest area (P&L or SI/CI).  
- Move on if stuck beyond 3 min on a question; mark it and return at the end if time remains.

### 3. Detailed Analysis (35–45 min)

After finishing:

1. **Check answers** and mark:
   - Correct, wrong, unattempted.

2. Compute:
   - Attempted count.
   - Correct count.
   - Accuracy = correct / attempted.

3. Categorize mistakes:
   - Conceptual:
     - e.g., Used wrong formula, misinterpreted relationship between MP, CP, SP, etc.
   - Arithmetic:
     - Mis-multiplication, sign errors.
   - Strategy:
     - Spent too long on one hard question; had to rush others.

4. Re-solve every wrong question:
   - Without looking at solution first, attempt again using your corrected understanding.  
   - If still confused, then read the solution, and immediately try a **similar new question** of that type.

5. Create a small “mistake log”:
   - Example format:
     - Q type: “P&L with discount + profit”
     - Error: “Messed up relation between CP and MP”
     - Fix: “Always define CP = 100 and follow multiplier chain.”

### 4. Weekly Reflection (10–15 min)

Write clearly (1–2 pages):

1. **Strengths after Week 2:**
   - e.g., “Comfortable with basic profit% / SI direct problems.”

2. **Weak spots:**
   - e.g., “Reverse CI problems where I need to find rate.”  
   - “Complex P&L chains (two or more people).”

3. **Plan for next week:**
   - During Week 3 (Time–Speed–Distance), dedicate:
     - 15–20 minutes/day to 4–5 mixed P&L/SI/CI revision problems, especially your weak patterns.

This makes sure your Week 1–2 learning doesn’t fade while you start TSD next week.

---

If you’d like, next I can create a **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 3** (Time–Speed–Distance & Trains/Boats), again with structured daily tasks and progressive difficulty.
