## Day 1 – Profit & Loss: Core Definitions and Direct Problems

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
Learn/refresh:
- Cost Price (CP), Selling Price (SP), Profit, Loss.
- Formulas:
  - Profit = SP – CP  
  - Loss = CP – SP  
  - Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100  
  - Loss%   = (Loss/CP) × 100
- Find unknown (CP, SP, Profit%, etc.) when others are given.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–35 min)
Target: **12–15 beginner-level questions**.

Problem types:
1. Direct profit/loss:
   - “CP = 800, SP = 920 → find profit & profit%.”
   - “CP = 600, SP = 540 → find loss & loss%.”
2. Finding SP given CP & profit%:
   - “CP = 500, profit% = 20 → SP?”
3. Finding CP given SP & profit%:
   - “SP = 960, profit% = 20 → CP?”
4. Zero profit/loss:
   - “SP = CP? → What is profit/loss%?”

**Reinforces**
- Always using **CP** as base for %.
- Rearranging formula correctly.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 6–8 questions:
  - 4–5 profit/loss (easy).
  - 2–3 percentage questions from Week 1 (to keep % skills fresh).

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- List formula patterns:
  - SP = CP × (1 + profit%/100).  
  - CP = SP / (1 + profit%/100).
- Note any confusion between using CP or SP as denominator.

## Day 2 – Profit, Loss & Discount: Marked Price, Discount %, Combined Cases

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- Marked Price (MP), Discount, Discount%:
  - Discount = MP – SP  
  - Discount% = (Discount/MP) × 100
- Relationship when CP also given:
  - Can have discount and still profit if MP high enough.
- Successive discounts (brief intro):
  - Two discounts d1 and d2:
    - Equivalent discount = d1 + d2 – (d1·d2 / 100)

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 beginner→intermediate questions**.

Problem types:
1. Single discount:
   - “MP = 1000, discount 20%. Find SP.”
2. CP, MP, discount:
   - “CP = 700, MP = 1000, discount 20%. Find profit or loss%.”
3. Given discount & profit%:
   - “Shopkeeper gives 10% discount on MP and still earns 20% profit on CP. If CP = 450, find MP.”
4. Successive discounts (2 steps):
   - “Two successive discounts of 10% and 20% on MP. Find single equivalent discount.”

**Reinforces**
- Thinking clearly about what % is calculated on:
  - Profit/Loss% on CP, Discount% on MP.
- Combining percentage effects.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 6–8 questions mixing:
  - 4 profit–loss–discount,
  - 2–3 percentage Word problems (Week 1).

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Write quick templates:
  - “SP after discount = MP × (1 – d/100).”
  - “SP after profit = CP × (1 + p/100).”
- Re-solve 2–3 questions where sequence (CP→MP→SP) confused you.

## Day 3 – Simple Interest: Basics & Direct Use of Formula

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- Simple Interest (SI) basics:
  - SI = (P × R × T) / 100  
  - Amount A = P + SI
- P = Principal, R = Rate per annum, T = Time in years.
- Finding unknown P, R, or T when others are given.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 beginner-level SI questions**.

Problem types:
1. Direct SI:
   - “Find SI on Rs. 5000 at 10% p.a. for 3 years.”
2. Find Amount:
   - “P = 8000, R = 12%, T = 2 years → find SI and Amount.”
3. Find R:
   - “SI on Rs. 6000 for 2 years is Rs. 720. Find rate.”
4. Find T:
   - “SI is Rs. 900 on Rs. 3000 at 10% p.a. Find time.”

**Reinforces**
- Direct formula use and rearranging:
  - R = (SI×100)/(P×T)  
  - T = (SI×100)/(P×R)  
  - P = (SI×100)/(R×T)

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 3–4 SI questions (smaller numbers).  
- 3–4 profit & loss questions from Days 1–2.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Create SI formula box in your notes.
- Identify if algebra manipulations (solving for R, T) are slow and revise.

   - “At same principal, SI at 5% for 3 yrs vs 8% for 2 yrs – which is more and by how much?”
2. Finding principal with combined information:
   - “Amount becomes Rs. 880 in 2 years at 10% p.a. Find principal.”
3. Simple “difference in SI” problems:
   - “Difference between SI at 12% and 15% on same sum for 3 years is Rs. 270. Find the sum.”

**Divisibility & Number System (6–7 questions)**
1. Check divisibility:
   - “Is 3276 divisible by 3, 4, 9, 11?”
2. Small conceptual:
   - “How many 3-digit numbers are divisible by 5?”

**Reinforces**
- Applying SI beyond direct formula.  
- Quickly testing divisibility rather than long division.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 3–4 SI problems.

- Constructing the equation for “leaves same remainder” type (intro, simple cases).

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 questions (intermediate level)**.

Problem types:
1. Repetition using LCM:
   - “Three bells ring every 4, 6, and 10 minutes. If they ring together at 10 AM, when will they ring together again?”
   - LCM of 4,6,10 = 60 → 60 minutes after 10 AM.
2. Using HCF:
   - “Find greatest length that can measure exactly 36m, 45m and 81m.”
3. Simple remainder problems using LCM:
   - “Find least number which when divided by 6, 8 and 15 leaves remainder 2 in each case.”
   - Number = LCM(6,8,15) × k + 2 → start with k=1 and test.

**Reinforces**
- Mapping a story to “LCM or HCF?”

- Profit, Loss & Discount: 7–9 Q  
- Simple Interest: 4–6 Q  
- Number System (divisibility, factors): 4–5 Q  
- LCM/HCF (word problems included): 4–5 Q

Sit for 35–40 minutes uninterrupted:
- First pass: answer all sure/easy Q quickly.  
- Second pass: work on medium/tough ones you skipped.

### 2. Mock Review (30–40 min)
For each wrong/guessed/skipped question:
- Mark **reason**:
  1. Conceptual gap (didn’t know/forgot concept).
  2. Misread / misinterpreted question.
  3. Calculation/speed error.
- For (1): revisit notes (formula or rule) and solve 1–2 similar questions.
- For (2): underline/circle keywords in the question (“at least”, “exactly”, “still gets profit”, etc.).
- For (3): redo calculations slowly and find exactly where you erred.

Create a **Week 2 Formula & Rule Sheet**:
- Profit, Loss, Discount formulas.  
- SI formula + rearranged forms.  
- Divisibility rules.  
- Steps for LCM/HCF by prime factorization.

### 3. Light Reinforcement (Optional, 15–20 min)
