## Day 1 – Number System Foundations & Divisibility (Part 1)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Types of Numbers**
- Natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational/irrational, prime, composite, even, odd.
- Prime numbers up to 50 (memorize quickly; helps in factorization).

b) **Place Value & Basic Operations**
- Understanding units, tens, hundreds; reading and writing numbers.
- Basic operations (add/subtract/multiply/divide) mentally for small numbers.

c) **Divisibility Rules (Start)**
- For 2, 3, 5, 9, 10:
  - 2 → last digit even  
  - 3, 9 → sum of digits divisible by 3/9  
  - 5 → last digit 0 or 5  
  - 10 → last digit 0

### 2. Guided Practice (40–50 min)

Do these types of questions (in any book/site like IndiaBix/PrepInsta/NQT PYQ):

**Beginner**
1. Classify: 0, 1, 2, 5, -3, 4.5 (natural, whole, integer, rational).
2. Write all prime numbers between 1–50.
3. Check divisibility:

- New value = Old value × (1 – x/100) for x% decrease

b) **Net Effect of Successive Changes**
- If value increases by a% then b%, net % = a + b + (ab/100).  
  (Today just see concept; deep use later.)

a) **Definition of Ratio**
- Comparison of quantities of same type: a:b.  
- Can be simplified: 50:80 = 5:8.

b) **Ratios & “Parts” Idea**
- For ratio a:b, total parts = a + b.  
- If total = T, then:
  - First part = (a/(a+b)) × T

### 1. Concept Revision (40–50 min)

- Review notes:
  - Divisibility rules (2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11).  
  - LCM/HCF via prime factorization.  
  - Percentages: conversions, basic calculations, increase/decrease.  
  - Ratios: simplification, parts, combined ratios.

- For each, solve 2–3 quick examples without looking at solutions.

- 4–5 from Number System + Divisibility  
- 4–5 from LCM/HCF  
- 6–8 from Percentages (incl. increase/decrease)  
- 6–8 from Ratios (incl. simple mixture-type)

Attempt them **in one sitting**:
- Time limit: 40–45 minutes.
- Treat it like an online test: no checking solution in between, no long breaks.

**After test (20–30 min review)**
- Check answers carefully.
- For each wrong/slow question:
  - Identify cause: concept gap / calculation error / misreading.  
  - Re-solve properly and write the corrected method in your notebook.

### 3. Planning Ahead (5–10 min)

- List the 2–3 subtopics you struggled with most (e.g., divisibility by 11, percent decrease, ratio chains).
- Mark them as **priority revision** early in Week 2 (before starting new topics).

If you share how much time you can commit per day (e.g., 1.5 hours vs 3 hours), I can compress or expand each day’s load and suggest exact question counts from online resources.
