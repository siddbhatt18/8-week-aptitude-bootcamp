Here’s a structured **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 7**, focused on:

- Seating/ordering **arrangements**  
- Simple **logic puzzles** (assignment/selection)  
- **Syllogisms** and basic verbal logic  

Target: **~1.5–2.5 hours per day**. Adjust as needed.

You’ll need: any reasoning book / online platform (IndiaBix, PrepInsta, RS Aggarwal Reasoning, company PYQs).

## Core Ideas for Week 7

- Represent information **visually**: tables, lines, circles, grids.  
- Always list and combine constraints systematically instead of trying to “see” the answer in your head.  
- For syllogisms, rely on **standard patterns** or quick Venn diagram thinking.

## Day 1 – Linear Arrangements: Basics

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **What is a linear arrangement?**

- People/objects in a row (left–right).  
- Conditions:  
  - “X is to the left of Y”  
  - “X is third to the right of Y”  
  - “X sits between Y and Z”  
  - “X is at one of the ends”

b) **Representation**

- Draw boxes: e.g., 7 positions: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`  
- Mark **fixed positions** first (ends, middle).  
- Use placeholders when order not fully known.

c) **Basic Strategy**

1. List all givens.  
2. Place the easiest/most restrictive clues first.  
3. Use pencil/rough work for trying possibilities.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. Six people A, B, C, D, E, F are sitting in a row facing north.
   - A is to the immediate left of B.  
   - C is at one of the ends.  
   - D is second to the right of B.  
   - E is not at any end.
   - Draw all possible arrangements.

2. Five friends P, Q, R, S, T are sitting in a row facing north.
   - Q is between P and R.  
   - S is to the immediate right of R.  
   - T is at an extreme end.  
   - Find order.

**Intermediate**

3. Seven people A, B, C, D, E, F, G sit in a row facing north.
   - B sits third to the left of G.  
   - E is at one of the ends.  
   - A sits second to the right of B.  
   - C is not neighbor of B.  
   - D sits to the right of F.
   - Find arrangement.

4. In a row of 8 persons, P sits 4th from left. Q is 2nd to the right of P. R sits at extreme right. S is at extreme left. (More conditions…)  
   - Solve fully and answer position-based questions like “Who sits between X and Y?”

**Reinforces**

- Translating text → row diagram  
- Handling “left/right of” correctly with everyone facing same direction

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 3–4 small linear arrangement questions (with 5–7 people).  
- Try each in **3–4 minutes** → ~12–15 minutes total.  
- Focus on drawing neat rows quickly.

### 4. Reflection (5–10 min)

- Note what confused you:
  - “Left/right” vs your drawing  
  - Choosing where to start  
- Write 1–2 generic steps to follow every time.

---

## Day 2 – Linear Arrangements: Moderate + Ranking/Position Questions

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

a) **More Complex Conditions**

- “X is **somewhere** to the left of Y” (not necessarily adjacent).  
- “Exactly two people sit between X and Y.”  
- Combining multiple partial orders.

b) **Ranking/Position Problems**

- “In a row of N students, A is 7th from left and 10th from right. How many students are there?”  
- Converts to **N = left position + right position – 1**.

### 2. Guided Practice (50–60 min)

**Linear Arrangements (3–4 problems)**

1. Eight people A–H sit in a row facing north.
   - C is to immediate right of A.  
   - Only two people between C and G.  
   - F is third to left of D.  
   - B is neighbor of G.  
   - E is not at any extreme.  
   - Complete arrangement; then answer who sits where.

2. Seven persons P–V sit in a row. Some are given relative positions with “exactly two between”, “immediate left/right”, “at one of the ends”.  
   - Practice a PYQ-type problem.

**Ranking/Position (4–6 problems)**

3. In a row, A is 8th from left and 13th from right. How many persons in row?  
4. In a row of students, B is 5th from top and 22nd from bottom. Find total.  
5. In a queue of 30, A is 10th from front. How many are behind A?  
6. If C is 15th from left in 40 students, what is his position from right?

**Reinforces**

- Handling “exactly k between”  
- Ranking formulas and reasoning

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 4–6 ranking/position questions.  
- Aim: **10–12 minutes**.  
- Try to derive formula without rethinking each time.

### 4. Short Recap (5–10 min)

- Write down:
  - Formula: N = left_pos + right_pos – 1  
  - Formula: number behind A = N – front_position(A)

---

## Day 3 – Circular Arrangements

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Circular vs Linear**

- People sit around a circle (facing center or facing outside).  
- No fixed “start” position; relative positions matter.

b) **Facing Center vs Facing Outwards**

- If facing center:  
  - Person’s left is anti-clockwise, right is clockwise.  
- If facing outwards: reversed.

c) **Strategy**

1. Fix one person at top (for reference).  
2. Place others around according to constraints.  
3. Use arrows or small marks to keep track of who faces where.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. Six people A–F sitting around a circle facing center.
   - B is to immediate left of A.  
   - C is between B and D.  
   - E is to immediate right of D.  
   - F is between A and E.  
   - Draw circle & find arrangement.

2. Eight friends seated around circle facing center. Conditions like “X is third to right of Y”, “Z is not neighbor of P” etc.  
   - Solve 1–2 simple sets.

**Intermediate**

3. Eight persons A–H sit around circle, some conditions:
   - C is second to right of A.  
   - F is neighbor of C and D.  
   - E sits opposite A.  
   - B is not neighbor of E.  
   - G is 3rd to left of D.  
   - Etc.

Solve and answer questions:
- Who sits opposite X?  
- Who is immediate left/right of Y?

**Advanced (1 problem if time permits)**

4. Variation with people facing **outside**.  
   - Pay attention to left/right carefully.

**Reinforces**

- Visualizing circular position relationships  
- Systematic placement using constraints hierarchy

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 2 small circular arrangement puzzles (6–7 people) from an online source.  
- Try to complete each in **7–8 minutes**.

### 4. Notes (5–10 min)

- Write short checklist:
  - Fix one person’s seat.  
  - Indicate direction of facing.  
  - Use consistent clockwise/anticlockwise notion for right/left.

---

## Day 4 – Simple Logic Puzzles (Assignment / Selection)

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

a) **What are Assignment Puzzles?**

- Example: 4 people have 4 different professions and live in 4 different cities; match who lives where and does what.  
- Use **tables** to track:

  | Person | City | Profession |
  |--------|------|------------|
  |   A    |      |            |

b) **Tools**

- Use ✔ and ✖ to mark possible / impossible pairs.  
- Deduce step by step using elimination.

### 2. Guided Practice (50–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. Four friends A, B, C, D have four different favorite colors: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow.
   - A doesn’t like Red or Blue.  
   - B likes neither Green nor Yellow.  
   - C likes Blue.  
   - D doesn’t like Green.  
   - Find each person’s favorite color using a table.

2. Five students P–T each study a different subject (Math, Physics, Chem, Bio, CS). Several clues about who likes/doesn’t like what.  
   - Fill table to find unique mapping.

**Intermediate**

3. 4 persons live in 4 different cities and drive 4 different car brands. You have clues like:
   - Person in Delhi drives Honda; B doesn’t live in Mumbai; etc.  
   - Complete a 4×4 grid.

4. Puzzle with days + tasks + people (common in company tests).  
   - 3–4 attributes to match.

**Reinforces**

- Diagrammatic representation (grids)  
- Systematic elimination rather than random guessing

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 1–2 small grid/assignment puzzles.  
- Give yourself **12–15 minutes** total.  
- Focus on making the grid neat and using eliminations logically.

### 4. Reflection (5–10 min)

- Note if:
  - You forgot to mark some implications.  
  - You jumped to conclusions without checking all constraints.

---

## Day 5 – Syllogisms (Basic to Medium)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Standard Categorical Statements**

- A: All A are B.  
- E: No A is B.  
- I: Some A are B.  
- O: Some A are not B.

b) **Typical Task**

- Given 2–3 statements, decide which conclusions **definitely** follow.

c) **Methods**

- Quick Venn diagram sketches.  
- Remember some standard patterns (if you are familiar) like:
  - All A are B + All B are C → All A are C.  
  - All A are B + Some B are C → Some A may be C (but not definite unless diagram forces).

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. Statements:  
   - All cats are animals.  
   - Some animals are wild.  
   Conclusions:  
   - I: Some cats are wild.  
   - II: All animals are cats.  
   - Decide which follow.

2. Statements:  
   - All A are B.  
   - No B is C.  
   Conclusions:  
   - I: No A is C.  
   - II: Some B are not A.  

Draw Venn diagrams.

**Intermediate**

3. 10–12 typical exam-style problems (2 statements + 2 conclusions).  
   - Practice using diagrams or pattern recognition.

4. Include examples with:
   - “Some A are B; Some B are C”  
   - “All A are B; Some B are not C”  
   - “No A is B; Some B are C”

**Advanced (optional, 2–3 Q)**

5. Syllogisms with “Possibility” questions:
   - e.g., “Some A being C is a possibility” etc. (if your target exams have this type).  

**Reinforces**

- Distinguishing “definitely true” vs “maybe”  
- Consistent Venn reasoning

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 10 syllogism questions (2–3 statements each).  
- Aim: **10–15 minutes**.  
- Try to get high accuracy even if slightly slower; speed will come with familiarity.

### 4. Quick Recap (5–10 min)

- Write 3–4 rules you found useful, e.g.:
  - From “All A are B”, we **cannot** say “Some B are A” is always true if we don’t know A exists.  
  - From “No A is B”, we know “Some A are not B” is not definitely true unless Some A exist.

---

## Day 6 – Mixed LR Practice (Arrangements + Puzzles + Syllogisms)

### 1. Warm-up (15–20 min)

- Do 2–3 very short questions from each:
  - 1 linear arrangement  
  - 1 circular arrangement  
  - 1 small grid puzzle  
  - 2 syllogisms  

Just to get back into the flow.

### 2. Mixed Problem Set (60–75 min)

Create or pick a mixed LR set of **15–20 questions**:

- 5–7 arrangement questions  
  - At least 2 linear, 2 circular  
- 3–5 small grid/assignment puzzles (1–2 Q each)  
- 5–8 syllogism questions

Attempt them in **60–75 minutes** in one sitting.

**Reinforces**

- Switching between different LR formats  
- Managing time + drawing diagrams quickly

### 3. Review (20–30 min)

- Check all answers. Categorize mistakes as:
  - Misinterpreted condition (LR).  
  - Diagram error (LR).  
  - Wrong logical inference (syllogism).  

Re-solve wrong ones from scratch and add tricky patterns to your mistake notebook.

---

## Day 7 – Weekly Revision + Mini-Mock (LR-Focused)

### 1. Concept Recap (30–40 min)

Quickly review:

- Linear arrangement:  
  - How to start, how to handle “exactly k between”, left/right.  
- Circular arrangement:  
  - Fixing a reference seat, facing direction.  
- Grid/assignment puzzles:  
  - How to structure the table and use elimination.  
- Syllogisms:  
  - Statement types, typical conclusion traps.

For each area, solve 1–2 representative questions without reference.

### 2. LR Mini-Mock (45–60 min)

Form or pick a mini-mock section:

- Total **20–25 LR questions**:
  - 8–10 arrangement/ordering (linear + circular)  
  - 4–6 assignment/selection puzzles  
  - 6–8 syllogisms / verbal logic statements  

Attempt under **45–50 minutes**, test conditions.

### 3. Error Analysis & Wrap-Up (25–35 min)

- Compute accuracy. For each mistake:
  - Was it reading/understanding issue or diagram error?  
  - For syllogisms, did you over-assume something not forced by statements?

Write 3–5 key improvement points; for example:

- “Always draw at least one rough diagram for arrangement questions, not just imagine.”  
- “When stuck in assignment puzzles, systematically mark X (impossible) in grid instead of holding in head.”  
- “For syllogisms, don’t mark a conclusion as definitely true unless every possible diagram supports it.”

---

From **Week 8** onward, you’ll shift to **full mixed mocks + targeted revision** of weak areas (arithmetic, DI, algebra, LR). If you tell me which LR type (arrangements / puzzles / syllogisms) currently feels hardest, I can suggest a small 10–15 min daily add-on drill focused on that pattern.
