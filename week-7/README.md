Here is your **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 7**, focused on:

- **Verbal Ability**: Reading Comprehension (RC), Grammar/Sentence Correction, Vocabulary-in-context  
- **Basic Critical Reasoning**: strengthen/weaken, assumptions, conclusions  
- Light **Quant/LR revision** so previous weeks don’t fade  

Assume ~**2.5–3 hours/day**. Structure:

> Learn core ideas → Study guided examples → Practice independently → Timed sets → Reflect.

You don’t need any special book; any standard placement-aptitude verbal resource (or online RC/grammar practice) will work.

---

## Day 1 – Reading Comprehension (RC): Short Factual Passages

**Main goal:** Learn a systematic way to read and answer questions on short, fact-based passages.

### 1. Concept Learning: How to Approach RC (25–30 min)

In your notebook, write and internalize this approach:

1. **Step 1: Skim for structure, not details**
   - Spend ~30–45 seconds:
     - Read the first and last sentences of the passage.  
     - Quickly skim the rest; mark any **topic words** or repeated ideas.

2. **Step 2: Identify the main idea**
   - Ask: “What is the passage *mainly* about?”  
   - Summarize in one line in your own words.

3. **Step 3: Read questions before re-reading details**
   - Glance at all questions once.  
   - This gives you a “map” of what to look for when you read more carefully.

4. **Step 4: Answer type classification**
   - Fact-based: direct answer in passage.  
   - Inference: answer must be supported, but not literally stated.  
   - Vocabulary-in-context: meaning of a word/phrase as used in passage.  
   - Main idea / title: what best expresses the whole passage.

5. **Step 5: Elimination**
   - Cross out options that:
     - Are too extreme (always/never, etc., if not supported).  
     - Talk about something not mentioned.  
     - Partly correct but miss key part of question.

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Take **2 short passages** (~150–200 words each), from any aptitude source.

For each passage:

1. Do a **structured read**:
   - 30–40 sec skim.  
   - Note a one-line main idea in your notebook.

2. Read all questions. Classify type:
   - Write “F” (fact), “I” (inference), “M” (main idea), “V” (vocab).

3. Answer questions one by one:
   - For fact questions, **underline** where in passage the answer comes from.  
   - For inference, ensure the answer is consistent with passage (not wild guess).

Then check solutions and see:
- Were you correct?  
- Did your main idea summary match the “intended” one?

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner (35–45 min)

Solve **3 more short RC passages** (100–200 words each):

- Each with ~3–5 questions (total ~10–15 questions).  
- Focus more on:
  - Understanding structure and main idea.  
  - Locating evidence in text.

Don’t time heavily today, but note roughly:
- Did any passage take >15 minutes? That’s a sign to streamline reading.

### 4. Light Quant/LR Revision (15–20 min)

Solve **8–10 quick questions**:

- 2 from Percentages/Ratios.  
- 2 from Averages or P&L/SI.  
- 2 from a small LR set (tiny linear or circular arrangement).  
- 2–4 very short DI questions.

Keep it light but consistent.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:

- Which part of RC felt hardest: understanding passage, main idea, or answering questions?  
- Did you tend to reread entire passage excessively?  
- One habit you will consciously use tomorrow (e.g., “always summarize main idea in 1 sentence”).

---

## Day 2 – RC: Inference & Tone + Slightly Longer Passages

**Main goal:** Practice questions that require reading between the lines and understanding author’s attitude.

### 1. Concept Learning: Inference, Tone, Main Idea (25–30 min)

Note in your notebook:

1. **Inference questions**
   - Ask: “What can be reasonably concluded from the passage?”  
   - The answer:
     - Must be supported by passage.  
     - Cannot contradict any statement.  
     - May not be explicitly stated.

2. **Tone / Attitude**
   - Look for words that show feeling:
     - Positive: “supports”, “praises”, “argues in favor of”.  
     - Negative: “criticizes”, “warns against”.  
     - Neutral/analytical: explains, describes, compares.
   - Common tones:
     - Descriptive, explanatory, critical, skeptical, optimistic, pessimistic.

3. **Main idea vs. detail**
   - Main idea covers **entire passage**, not a single detail.  
   - Wrong choices often:
     - Are too narrow (only one example).  
     - Are too broad (beyond what passage says).

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Take **2 passages**, slightly longer (~250–350 words).

For each:

1. Skim → main idea (1 line).  
2. Read questions and tag types.  
3. Answer:
   - Fact questions (easy).  
   - Then **inference** and **tone** questions; focus here.

Write:
- Why you eliminated each wrong option.  
- For tone, write a single descriptive word (e.g., “critical of policy”, “supportive of technology”).

Check solutions and compare.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Do **2–3 RC passages** (~200–350 words), 4–6 questions each (10–15 Q total):

- Ensure at least:
  - 2–3 inference questions.  
  - 1–2 main idea/title questions.  
  - 1–2 tone/attitude or purpose questions.

Try to give yourself a **soft time budget**:
- ~10–12 minutes per shorter passage,  
- ~12–15 minutes for longer ones.

### 4. Short Grammar/Vocab Warm-up (10–15 min)

Do **5–7 quick questions**:

- 3–4 fill-in-the-blanks (choose best word in context).  
- 2–3 synonyms/antonyms or vocab-in-context (from any resource).

Don’t worry about memorizing lists – focus on **context clues**.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Ask and write:

- Do you find tone questions confusing? If yes, which tones felt similar (e.g., “critical” vs “skeptical”)?  
- Did you notice that wrong inference answers were often too strong or unmentioned?

---

## Day 3 – Grammar & Sentence Correction: Core Rules

**Main goal:** Learn key grammar patterns for placement exams and apply them to error-spotting / correction.

### 1. Concept Learning: High-frequency Grammar (30–40 min)

Focus on a **limited but powerful** set of rules:

1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**
   - Singular subject → singular verb; plural → plural.  
   - Watch out for:
     - “Each of”, “Everyone”, “Neither/Nor” → usually singular.  
     - “A number of” (plural), “The number of” (singular).

2. **Tenses & Consistency**
   - Don’t randomly shift from past to present without reason.

3. **Pronoun Reference**
   - Pronouns (he, she, it, they, this, that) must clearly refer to a specific noun.

4. **Articles (a, an, the)**
   - “a/an” for general, “the” for specific/known items.

5. **Common preposition usage**
   - e.g., “interested in”, “depend on”, “good at”.

6. **Redundancy & wordiness**
   - Avoid double negatives or repeated meaning (e.g., “return back”).

Write examples for each, with both correct and incorrect versions.

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Take **10–12 sentence correction/error spotting examples**:

Types:
- Identify part of sentence that has an error.  
- Or choose the best version of a sentence from 4 options.

For each:
- Identify **which rule** is being tested.  
- Correct the sentence in your own words.

E.g.:
- “Each of the boys are ready.” → “Each of the boys **is** ready.” (subject-verb).  
- “She did not said anything.” → “She did not say anything.” (auxiliary + base verb).

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner to Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **20–25 grammar questions**:

- 10–12 pure error spotting.  
- 8–10 sentence correction / choose best form.

Focus on:
- Single clear error (for now).  
- Mark the rule type for each (S-V agreement, tense, pronoun, etc.).

Try not to overthink; go with **grammatical feel + basic rules**.

### 4. Short RC Practice (10–15 min)

Do **1 very short RC passage** (150–200 words, 3–4 Q):

- Goal: keep RC skill alive while working on grammar.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:

- Which type of grammar rule is easiest for you?  
- Which kind keeps tricking you (e.g., pronouns, subject-verb with “each/every”)?  
- Note them as **priority rules** to review before mock tests.

---

## Day 4 – Vocabulary in Context & Fill-in-the-Blanks

**Main goal:** Improve ability to understand and choose words based on context, not rote memorization.

### 1. Concept Learning: Using Context Clues (20–25 min)

Understand that in placement tests:

- You rarely need to know every word.  
- You use **context clues**:

1. **Definition clues**:  
   - “The arboreal creatures, or tree-dwelling animals, …” → “arboreal = tree-dwelling”.

2. **Contrast clues** (but, however, although):  
   - “Unlike his gregarious sister, he was quite taciturn.”  
     - gregarious = outgoing; taciturn ≈ quiet.

3. **Example clues** (such as, for example, like):  
   - “Celestial bodies, such as the sun and stars, …” → celestial = in the sky/space.

4. **Cause-effect clues** (because, therefore, so):  
   - They show why something is happening, hinting at word meaning.

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Take **10 fill-in-the-blank / vocab-in-context questions**:

- Single-blank or double-blank sentences.  
- For each:
  - Read whole sentence, not just blank.  
  - Identify clue words (but, although, because, etc.).  
  - Eliminate options that clearly don’t fit tone or meaning.

Example:
- “Despite his ____ nature, he managed to make a few close friends.”  
  - Clue: “Despite” suggests negative quality, but still friends.  
  - Words like “shy”, “reserved” might fit.

Write reasoning for choosing and for rejecting other options.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **20–25 questions**:

- 10–15 single-blank fill-in-the-blanks.  
- 5–10 vocab-in-context / synonym-antonym questions.

Focus:
- Always use sentence meaning and logical consistency.  
- When you meet a new word:
  - Guess meaning from context.  
  - Optionally look it up later and write a 3–5 word definition in your notebook.

### 4. Short Grammar or RC Top-up (10–15 min)

Choose one:

- Either:
  - 8–10 quick grammar error-spotting questions,  
- Or:
  - 1 short RC passage (3–4 Q).

Just to keep both skills active.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:

- Are you able to eliminate 2 wrong options quickly in most fill-in-the-blank questions?  
- Did you notice patterns (e.g., many blanks test contrast, so words like “but/although” matter a lot)?

---

## Day 5 – Introduction to Critical Reasoning: Arguments, Conclusions, Strengthen/Weaken

**Main goal:** Learn to identify conclusions and understand how new information affects an argument.

### 1. Concept Learning: Arguments & Conclusions (25–30 min)

Important ideas:

1. **Argument vs. Facts**
   - Argument: set of statements where some support a **conclusion**.  
   - Facts: stand-alone statements.

2. **Conclusion**
   - The main claim the author wants you to accept.  
   - Often (not always) after words like “therefore”, “thus”, “so”, “hence”.

3. **Premises (reasons)**
   - Statements that support the conclusion.

4. **Strengthen/Weaken questions**
   - **Strengthen**: new info that makes conclusion **more likely**.  
   - **Weaken**: new info that makes conclusion **less likely**.

Golden rule:
- The conclusion depends on certain **assumptions**.  
- Strengthen: supports these assumptions.  
- Weaken: attacks these assumptions.

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Take **5–6 short arguments** (2–4 sentences each) with MCQ questions:

For each:

1. Identify:
   - Conclusion (underline).  
   - Premises/support (circle).

2. For a strengthen question:
   - Pick the option that **bridges the gap** between premises and conclusion, or adds support.

3. For a weaken question:
   - Pick the option that shows an **alternative cause**, **exception**, or **contradiction** to conclusion.

Write reasoning:
- Why the correct option helps or hurts the conclusion.  
- Why the other options are irrelevant or weak.

Example skeleton:
- Argument: “City A banned cars in downtown; air quality improved. Therefore, banning cars is the main reason for better air.”  
  - Strengthen: “No other major policies affecting air quality were introduced in that period.”  
  - Weaken: “Factories in the city also cut emissions by 90% the same year.”

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner to Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **10–15 critical reasoning questions**:

- 4–6 identify conclusion/premise questions.  
- 4–6 strengthen/weaken questions.  
- Plus 2–3 “assumption” or “flaw” type if available.

For each:
- Paraphrase the argument in your own words.  
- State conclusion explicitly.  
- Then pick the option.

### 4. Short RC or Grammar Practice (10–15 min)

Do either:

- 1 short RC (3–4 Q),  
or  
- 8–10 quick grammar/error spotting questions.

Keep things balanced.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:

- Do you clearly spot the conclusion in most arguments?  
- Did any strengthen/weaken option initially feel “right” but turned out irrelevant? Why?  
- Note one pattern you’ll watch out for (like “new comparison group”, “alternative cause”).

---

## Day 6 – Mixed Verbal Practice: RC + Grammar + Vocab + CR

**Main goal:** Combine all Week 7 skills and practice switching between them.

### 1. Quick Review (15–20 min)

Without looking at notes, quickly write:

- 3 key RC strategies (main idea, question-types, elimination).  
- 3 grammar rules you must remember.  
- Steps to solve a strengthen/weaken CR question.

Then check notes and correct.

### 2. Mixed Verbal Set 1 – Untimed (35–40 min)

Do a **mixed practice block**:

- 1 RC passage (~250–350 words, 4–6 Q).  
- 8–10 grammar/error-spotting questions.  
- 5 fill-in-the-blanks/vocab-in-context Qs.  
- 5 critical reasoning Qs (identify conclusion, strengthen/weaken).

Total: ~22–26 questions.

Solve without timer but keep an eye on:

- Clarity of thinking.  
- Avoiding random guessing.

### 3. Mixed Verbal Set 2 – Timed (25–30 min)

Create or pick another smaller mixed set:

- 1 short RC (~3–4 Q).  
- 5–7 grammar/vocab questions.  
- 3–4 CR questions.

Total: ~12–15 Q.  
Set a **25–30 min** timer.

Afterward, note:
- Time distribution: did RC eat most time, or CR, or grammar?

### 4. Light Quant/LR Refresh (15–20 min)

Do **8–10 quick questions**:

- 2 from DI.  
- 2 from basic arithmetic (percentages/ratios).  
- 2 from TSD/Time & Work.  
- 2–4 from simple LR (1 easy set or a few independent questions).

This keeps your non-verbal aptitude active.

### 5. Error Review & Reflection (15–20 min)

From today’s verbal sets:

- Pick **2 mistakes from each area** (RC, Grammar, Vocab, CR).  
- For each:
  - Why was your chosen answer wrong?  
  - What pattern or rule did the correct answer follow?

Write 4–6 key “takeaways” for future mocks.

---

## Day 7 – Week 7 Verbal Mini Mock + Consolidation

**Main goal:** Test yourself under exam-like conditions on verbal, with minor Quant/LR inclusion.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

Do a light warm-up:

- 1 very short RC (2–3 questions) or a paragraph to read carefully.  
- 3–4 grammar/vocab questions.  
- 1 very short CR question.

Just enough to get your reading/logic engine running.

### 2. Week 7 Verbal Mini Mock (45–50 min)

Prepare a mini mock with **25 questions**:

- **Reading Comprehension (8–10 Q)**  
  - 2 passages:  
    - 1 shorter (~150–200 words, 3–4 Q).  
    - 1 longer (~250–350 words, 5–6 Q).

- **Grammar & Sentence Correction (6–8 Q)**  
  - Mix of error spotting and sentence correction.

- **Vocabulary / Fill-in-the-Blanks (4–5 Q)**  
  - Context-based.

- **Critical Reasoning (3–4 Q)**  
  - Identify conclusion/assumption/strengthen/weaken.

- **Misc Quant/LR (2–3 Q)**  
  - Just to keep you in the habit (very small part).

Rules:

- Time: **45–50 minutes**, no interruptions.  
- Don’t check solutions mid-way.  
- Use pen and rough paper; no dictionary.

Strategy:

- Quickly scan sections.  
- Start with RC or Grammar, depending on your strength.  
- Don’t let one tough RC question sink your time; move on and return later if possible.

### 3. Analysis (35–45 min)

After test:

1. Mark:
   - Correct, wrong, unattempted.

2. Calculate:
   - Total attempted.  
   - Correct.  
   - Accuracy = correct / attempted.

3. Break down by section:

   - RC:
     - Were your main problems time, comprehension, or question traps?  
   - Grammar:
     - Which rules were most violated?  
   - Vocab:
     - Were you confused due to lack of word knowledge or ignoring context?  
   - CR:
     - Did you misidentify conclusion, or pick options that repeated premises?

4. Re-solve:
   - For every wrong/uncertain question, reason it out again.  
   - Check solution and write 1–2 line explanation of why correct option is better.

5. Update your **Verbal Mistake Log**:
   - Grammar patterns to watch.  
   - RC traps (e.g., extreme options, out-of-scope options).  
   - CR common flaws (alternative cause, correlation vs causation, etc.).

### 4. Weekly Reflection (10–15 min)

Answer in writing:

1. Rate yourself (1–10) on:
   - RC understanding and accuracy.  
   - Grammar correctness.  
   - Vocab-in-context ability.  
   - CR reasoning.

2. Biggest 2–3 weaknesses now in Verbal:
   - E.g., “Tone questions”, “Subject-verb agreement”, “CR weaken questions”.

3. Concrete plan for coming weeks:
   - e.g.,  
     - “Daily: 1 RC passage (10–15 min).”  
     - “Daily: 10 grammar questions.”  
     - “3 times/week: 5 CR questions.”

4. Overall stamina:
   - Can you read and think clearly for ~45–60 minutes without big fatigue?

---

You now have 7 weeks of structured preparation across Quant, DI, LR, and Verbal.  

If you’d like, I can design **Week 8 (Day 1–7)** as a full integration week: mixed-topic sectional tests, 2–3 full-length mock tests, and a targeted revision schedule based on your weak areas.
