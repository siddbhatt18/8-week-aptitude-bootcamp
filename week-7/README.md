Here’s your **Week 7 (Day 1–7) plan**, focused on:

- Mixed practice from all quant topics (Weeks 1–6).  
- Building **speed + accuracy**.  
- Learning **test strategy** (skipping, question selection, time management).  

Assume ~1.5–2 hours/day. If you have more time, add extra mixed sets or one more mock.

Core topics to keep in rotation:
- Percentages, Ratios, Averages, Profit–Loss–Discount, SI.  
- Time–Speed–Distance, Time & Work, Pipes & Cisterns, Simple Mixtures.  
- Number System (LCM/HCF, remainders, last digit), Linear Equations.  
- DI (table/bar/pie/line) + basic LR puzzles.  
- P&C (basic) + Probability (basic).

## Overall Structure for Week 7

You’re now past “learning mode” and more into “exam mode”:

- **Day 1–4:** Topic-wise mixed sets (with light timing) + immediate review.  
- **Day 5:** Full-length quant section simulation (without DI/LR, or a lighter mix).  
- **Day 6:** Weak-area drilling + one short sectional test.  
- **Day 7:** Mixed mock (more like company pattern) + reflection and strategy.

Use any platform that lets you generate **topic-tagged** questions, e.g. PrepInsta, IndiaBix, GeeksforGeeks, or company-specific sheets.

## Day 1 – Arithmetic & Business Math Speed Session

**Focus:**  
Percentages, Ratios, Averages, Profit–Loss–Discount, Simple Interest.

### 1. Warm-up & Recall (10–15 min)
- Skim your Week 1–2 formula sheets:
  - % ↔ fraction table, average = sum/n, profit/loss/discount formulas, SI formula.  
- Mentally solve 3–4 very easy questions (no writing) just to “switch on.”

### 2. Timed Mixed Set 1 (Core Arithmetic) (35–40 min)

Target: **20 questions**, mix them roughly as:
- 4–5 Percentages (incl. increase/decrease, successive %).  
- 4–5 Ratios & Averages (including weighted avg / effect on average).  
- 4–5 Profit–Loss–Discount.  
- 3–4 Simple Interest / small number system (LCM/HCF) if needed.

Give yourself **35–40 minutes** max.  
Goal: 70–80% accuracy, not 100%. Learn to skip time-consuming ones early.

### 3. Review & Error Analysis (25–30 min)
For each wrong/slow question, tag:

- Type: (% / ratio / average / PLD / SI).  
- Reason:
  1. Formula gap.  
  2. Misread.  
  3. Calculation error.  
  4. Spent too long.

Re-solve 5–7 of the most instructive questions slowly and correctly.

### 4. Short Reinforcement (10–15 min)
- Do **5 “fast” questions** (easy ones from the same topics) with a strict 1-minute limit each to practice speed.

---

## Day 2 – Work, Distance & Pipes Speed Session

**Focus:**  
Time–Speed–Distance, Time & Work, Pipes & Cisterns, Boats/Streams (if relevant).

### 1. Quick Concept Check (10–15 min)
- Revisit:
  - D = S × T, average speed, relative speed.  
  - Rate = 1/time for Work, combined work.  
  - Pipes: net rate (fills – empties).

Write the core formulas once to refresh.

### 2. Timed Mixed Set 2 (Work & Distance) (35–40 min)

Target: **18–20 questions**:
- 6–7 TSD (include at least 2 relative speed, 1 average speed).  
- 6–7 Time & Work (2-person, 3-person, one leaves/joins).  
- 4–6 Pipes & Cisterns / Boats & Streams (if your exams use them).

Time: **35–40 minutes**.

Use this approach:
- First ~10 minutes: clear the easiest-looking questions (ones with simple numbers and no complex wording).  
- Then move to the rest.

### 3. Review & Pattern Identification (25–30 min)
- For each TSD & Work/Pipes question:
  - Write: “Pattern: relative / average / work-with-people-leaving / pipes-net-rate.”  
- Note which patterns you consistently:
  - Recognize slowly, or  
  - Set up equations incorrectly.

Re-solve 5–6 questions of your weakest pattern type.

### 4. Micro-Drill (10–15 min)
- Take **3 questions of your weakest type** (e.g., relative speed or work-people-leaving).  
- Solve them again from scratch, aiming to finish each within 2 minutes.

---

## Day 3 – Number System, Algebra & Mixtures Session

**Focus:**  
LCM/HCF, divisibility, remainders/last digits, linear equations, mixtures/alligation.

### 1. Flash Recall (10–15 min)
- LCM/HCF rules (prime factorization).  
- Basic remainder/mod, last digit cycles.  
- Linear equation forms and mixture/alligation templates.

### 2. Timed Mixed Set 3 (35–40 min)

Target: **18–20 questions**:
- 4–5 LCM/HCF/divisibility.  
- 4–5 Remainders / last digits.  
- 4–5 Linear equations & simple algebraic word problems.  
- 4–5 Mixtures & Alligation (2–3 basic + 1–2 replacement).

Time: **35–40 minutes**.

### 3. Review & Concept Refresh (25–30 min)
For each error:

- If remainder/last digit:  
  - Did you use cycles/ modular arithmetic?  
- If linear equation:  
  - Was the equation translation from English correct?
- If mixture/alligation:  
  - Did you correctly place high, low, mean values?

Revisit the relevant concept briefly, then re-solve 4–5 of the trickiest ones.

### 4. Quick Drill (10–15 min)
- Solve 4–5 quick remainder/last-digit problems to improve speed on modular thinking.

---

## Day 4 – DI, LR & P&C/Probability Light Mix

**Focus:**  
Refresh DI/LR and light practice of P&C + Probability.

### 1. Mini Concept Recap (10–15 min)
- DI: reading tables, bar, pie, line; percent change and ratios inside DI.  
- LR: seating and distribution puzzle setup.  
- P&C: nCr vs nPr and basic arrangements.  
- Probability: favourable/total outcomes, coins/dice basic patterns.

### 2. Mixed Set 4 – DI + LR (30–35 min)

Target:
- **2 DI sets** (table/bar/pie/line) ≈ 8–10 Q total.  
- **1 LR puzzle** (seating or distribution) ≈ 4–6 Q.

Time: **30–35 minutes** total.

Focus:
- Don’t over-calc in DI; approximate where safe.  
- Draw a clear diagram/table for LR immediately.

### 3. Short P&C + Probability Drill (20–25 min)

Target: **8–10 questions**:
- 3–4 simple P&C (selection vs arrangement, basic word/digit formation).  
- 4–6 probability (coins/dice/balls, at least one type).

Not heavily timed, but aim for ~2 min or less per question.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Mark:
  - Any DI set where you misread data.  
  - Any LR puzzle where your initial diagram was flawed.  
  - Any P&C/Prob question where you mis-identified permutation vs combination or messed up total outcomes.

Re-solve 2–3 of these carefully.

---

## Day 5 – Full Quant Section Simulation (No DI/LR) 

**Focus:**  
Simulate a typical “Quantitative Aptitude” section (without DI/LR), to practice pacing.

### 1. Full Section Test (45–50 min)

Create/choose a test of **30 questions**:
- Arithmetic (Week 1–2): ~10 Q.  
- Work/Distance/Mixtures: ~8–10 Q.  
- Number System/Algebra: ~6–8 Q.  
- P&C/Probability: ~4–6 Q.

Total time: **45–50 minutes**.

Strategy during test:
- First pass (20–25 min):  
  - Do all obviously easy/medium ones in order.  
  - If stuck beyond ~2 minutes, skip and mark.
- Second pass:  
  - Return to marked ones if time remains.

Try to avoid getting emotionally stuck on any single question.

### 2. Detailed Review (35–40 min)
For each of the 30 questions:

- Note:
  - Topic.  
  - Time taken (roughly).  
  - Correct/Incorrect/Skipped.
- For all incorrect/skipped:
  - Classify:
    1. Concept gap.  
    2. Misinterpretation.  
    3. Arithmetic/time mismanagement.

Pick **6–8 representative questions** and:
- Re-solve them properly.  
- Write a one-line insight like:  
  - “I should have seen this was a standard time & work pattern.”  
  - “I wasted time expanding; ratio approach is shorter.”

## Day 6 – Targeted Weak-Area Drill + Short Sectional Test

**Focus:**  
Close your biggest gaps from Days 1–5.

### 1. Identify Top 2–3 Weak Areas (10–15 min)
From your logs so far, choose:
- 2–3 topics where:
  - You got many errors, OR  
  - You took too much time.

Examples: “Relative speed”, “Alligation”, “Remainders”, “P&C with repetition”, etc.

### 2. Focused Topic Drills (40–45 min)

For each weak area (say 2–3 topics):

- Do **6–8 questions** per topic (total 12–20 Q).  
- Not fully untimed, but aim for ~2 min/question.

Example splits:
- 8 TSD relative speed Q + 8 Alligation Q.  
or  
- 6 Remainders + 6 P&C + 6 Time & Work variations.

While solving:
- Use a fixed template/approach for that topic.

### 3. Short Sectional Test (Quant Mini) (20–25 min)

Take a **mini-test of 12–15 mixed questions**, focusing especially on your weak areas, in **20–25 minutes**.

- Try to apply improved patterns/shortcuts.  
- Practice skipping again if something goes out of hand.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Check accuracy improvement vs earlier in the week for these topics.  
- Note 1–2 formulas/methods newly clarified.

---

## Day 7 – Mixed Mock (Closer to Real Company Pattern) + Strategy Reflection

**Focus:**  
Simulate an actual online assessment section and then refine your personal strategy.

### 1. Mixed Mock Test (50–60 min)

Set up **one full mock** with:
- 30–35 questions, including:
  - 6–8 Arithmetic (percent/ratio/avg/PLD/SI).  
  - 6–8 Work/Distance/Pipes/Mixtures.  
  - 4–6 Number System/Algebra/Remainders.  
  - 4–6 DI questions.  
  - 3–5 P&C/Probability.  
  - 2–4 LR puzzle questions (may come from 1–2 puzzles).

Time: **50–60 minutes**.

Use exam strategy:
- Start with your strongest areas (e.g., arithmetic, TSD, or DI—depends on you).  
- Skip obviously long/twisty puzzles initially.  
- Keep an eye on the clock every 10–15 minutes.

### 2. Post-Mock Deep Review (40–45 min)
For this mock, do a deeper reflection:

- Overall:
  - Accuracy (%)  
  - Attempt count (# attempted vs total)  
  - Which 10 questions took the longest?

- By topic:
  - Where did errors concentrate?  
  - Any new weak patterns showing up?

Re-solve:
- 5 hardest arithmetic/word problems.  
- 1 DI set you struggled with.  
- 1 LR puzzle (if you didn’t fully crack it).

### 3. Strategy & Plan for Week 8 (15–20 min)
Write down:

1. **Strong areas** (attempt early in real exam):  
   - e.g., simple Arithmetic, Time & Work, basic DI.

2. **Moderate areas** (attempt after easy ones):  
   - e.g., P&C/Probability, Remainders.

3. **Weak/slow areas** (attempt only if time permits):  
   - e.g., tough LR, heavy-alligation/mixture, complex P&C.

Also note:
- Your preferred **order** of attempting sections/topics in a real test.  
- Your **target attempt count** (e.g., “In 40 min quant section, I’ll aim to correctly solve 22–25 Q with 80%+ accuracy.”)

---

## By End of Week 7, You Should:

- Handle **mixed sets** of quant questions under time pressure.  
- Know **which topics you’re strong/weak in**, and which to do first in a test.  
- Be comfortable skipping and returning to questions instead of getting stuck.  
- Have an evolving personal strategy for the final **Week 8 full mock focus**.

If you want, I can now design **Week 8 (Day 1–7)** specifically around full mock tests and final polishing for actual placement OAs.
