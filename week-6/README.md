Here is a structured **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 6**, focused on:

- Forming and solving **linear equations** from word problems  
- **Age and number** problems  
- **Mixture/alligation** basics (high‑yield)  
- Simple **quadratic-pattern** aptitude questions  

Target: **~1.5–2.5 hours per day**. Adjust as needed.

---

## Core Ideas for Week 6

- The main skill: **translate English → equation(s)**, then solve.  
- Most aptitude word problems (ages, numbers, mixtures, etc.) reduce to:
  - One variable or two variables  
  - Linear equations, or simple quadratic patterns (like n(n+1), consecutive numbers)

---

## Day 1 – Translating Words to Linear Equations (Basics)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Language to Algebra**

Learn to convert phrases to algebra:

- “A number” → x  
- “3 more than a number” → x + 3  
- “5 less than a number” → x – 5  
- “Twice a number” → 2x  
- “Three times a number decreased by 4” → 3x – 4  
- “Sum of two numbers is 20” → x + y = 20  
- “Difference between two numbers is 6” → x – y = 6 (or |x – y| = 6)

b) **Solving Simple Linear Equations**

- ax + b = c → x = (c – b)/a  
- For two variables: use substitution or elimination.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner: One-variable**

1. The sum of a number and 7 is 25. Find the number.  
2. 4 more than twice a number is 18. Find the number.  
3. 3 times a number minus 5 equals 16. Find the number.  
4. If 5 is subtracted from a number, the result is 12. What is the number?

**Intermediate: Two-variable (simple)**

5. The sum of two numbers is 50 and their difference is 10. Find the numbers.  
6. The sum of two numbers is 30. One number is 4 more than the other. Find both.  
7. The sum of two numbers is 40. One number is 3 times the other. Find both.

**Light Word Problems**

8. A pen and a pencil together cost ₹25. The pen costs ₹7 more than the pencil. Find their costs.  
9. A bus ticket and a train ticket together cost ₹110. Train ticket costs ₹40 more than bus ticket. Find each.

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 10 very short “form equation & solve” problems:
  - E.g., “Twice a number plus 5 is 17” etc.  
- Aim: **10–12 minutes**, write the equation and answer.

### 4. Reflection (5–10 min)

- Note which wording confused you (e.g., “x more than y” vs “x less than y”).  
- Write 3 example sentences of your own and translate them to equations.

## Day 2 – Age Problems (Linear Equations in Word Form)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Key Ideas in Age Problems**

- “Present age” → variable (usually x).  
- “k years ago” → (x – k).  
- “k years later” → (x + k).  
- For two people:
  - A’s present age = x, B’s present age = y
  - Relationship: A is 3 years older than B → x = y + 3  
  - Ratios: “Present ages in ratio 3:4” → x : y = 3 : 4.

b) **Patterns**

- Past/future ratios:
  - “5 years ago, ratio was …”  
  - “After 10 years, ratio will be …”

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. Present age of A is 25. What was his age 5 years ago? What will it be 7 years later?  
2. A is 4 years older than B. If B is 18, find A’s age.  
3. Sum of ages of A and B is 50. If A is 10 years older than B, find their ages.

**Intermediate**

4. Father is 3 times as old as his son. If the sum of their ages is 48, find their ages.  
5. Present ages of A and B are in ratio 4:5. Sum of their ages is 72. Find their present ages.  
6. 5 years ago, A’s age was 3 times B’s age. After 10 years, A’s age will be twice B’s age. Find their present ages.

**Advanced (1–2 problems)**

7. Present ages of A and B are in ratio 5:7. Four years from now, the ratio of their ages will be 3:4. Find their present ages.  
8. The sum of the ages of a father and his son is 60. 5 years ago, father was 4 times as old as son. Find present ages.

**Reinforces**

- Correct handling of “ago” and “after”  
- Ratios in ages → equations  
- Solving 2‑variable linear systems from word statements

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 5–7 age problems mixed difficulty.  
- Try to solve in **15 minutes**.  
- Focus: writing clear equations before solving.

### 4. Short Recap (5–10 min)

- Write generic template for age problems:
  1. Define variables (present ages).  
  2. Convert “ago/after” correctly.  
  3. Set up equations or ratios.  
  4. Solve & interpret answers.

## Day 3 – Number Problems & Intro to Quadratic Patterns

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Number Problems (Linear)**

Typical phrases:
- “Two-digit number” with tens and units:  
  - Let tens digit = x, units digit = y → number = 10x + y  
- “Sum of digits, reversed digits” etc.

b) **Simple Quadratic Patterns**

Many problems reduce to:
- Product or sum of consecutive numbers, e.g.:
  - n(n+1) = given  
  - (2n – 1)(2n + 1) = given (consecutive odds)  
- We’ll keep this light but useful for exams.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

1. Sum of two consecutive integers is 37. Find the integers.  
2. Sum of three consecutive integers is 72. Find them.

4. Sum of two consecutive odd numbers is 40. Find numbers.

**Intermediate – Two-digit Numbers**

5. A two-digit number is such that the sum of its digits is 11. If we reverse the digits, the new number is 27 less than the original. Find the number.  
   - Let number = 10x + y; x + y = 11; (10x + y) – (10y + x) = 27.

6. The sum of digits of a two-digit number is 9. If 27 is added to the number, its digits interchange. Find the number.

- Try for **15 minutes** max.

### 4. Reflection (5–10 min)

- Note if:
  - You mis-handled the reversed number formula.  
  - Solving quadratics by smart guessing (around square root) feels okay or not.

## Day 4 – Mixtures & Alligation (Concepts + Basic Problems)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Mixture Basics**

- Mixing two components (e.g., two types of rice, milk & water, acid & water) with different “strengths”/prices → find average value or ratio.  

- Weighted average:
  - Result = (quantity₁×value₁ + quantity₂×value₂) / (quantity₁ + quantity₂)

b) **Alligation Rule (Visual Method)**

For two components with values A and B, making mixture of value M:

- Place values like:

      A      M      B
       \    / \    /
      diff₁     diff₂

where:
- diff₁ = |M – B| (for quantity of A)  
- diff₂ = |M – A| (for quantity of B)

Ratio of quantities:  
- Quantity of A : Quantity of B = diff₂ : diff₁

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner – Simple Average Mixtures**

   - First find effective CP of mixture (using SP & profit), then alligation.

8. A mixture contains milk and water in ratio 4:1. How much water must be added to 20 liters of this mixture so that milk becomes 60% of new mixture?  
   - Let added water = x. Use mlk/water amounts.

## Day 6 – Linear Equations (Two Variables) & Slightly Harder Patterns

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

a) **Two-variable Linear System Refresh**

- General form:  
  - a₁x + b₁y = c₁  
  - a₂x + b₂y = c₂  

Popular methods:
- Elimination (align coefficients, add/subtract).  
- Substitution (solve one equation for x or y).

b) **Typical Aptitude Patterns**

- “Cost of 2 pens and 3 pencils is 34; cost of 4 pens and 1 pencil is 40” etc.  
- “Heads + legs of animals problem” (with cows/chickens).

### 2. Guided Practice (50–60 min)

## Day 7 – Weekly Revision + Mini-Mock (Algebra & Word Problems)

### 1. Concept Recap (35–45 min)

Review key Week 6 areas:

- Translating statements → equations  
- Age problems (past/future, ratios)  
- Number/digit problems (10x + y, consecutive numbers)  
- Mixtures & alligation  
- Linear systems in two variables

For each area, do 1–2 quick representative problems from your notes without solutions.

### 2. Mini-Mock Test (45–60 min)

Create or pick a **20–25 question** set with mix:

- 5–7 age problems  
- 5–7 number/digit & consecutive numbers problems  
- 4–6 mixture/alligation problems  
- 4–6 general linear-equation word problems (pens/pencils, animals, money, etc.)

Attempt under:

- Time limit: **45–50 minutes**  
- One sitting, test-like conditions

### 3. Error Analysis (25–35 min)

- Check answers. For wrong/slow questions:
  - Was the **translation** from English to algebra wrong?  
  - Was the algebra/calc step wrong?  
  - Did you miss a condition (like “consecutive”, “ago”, “after” etc.)?

Write 2–3 key takeaways, e.g.:

- “Always write ‘present ages’ explicitly before dealing with ago/after.”  
- “For digit problems, always define tens = x, units = y; number = 10x + y.”  
- “Use alligation diagram whenever mixing two values.”

Add the most confusing samples to your mistake book for later revision.

---

From Week 7 onward, you’ll emphasize **Logical Reasoning and Puzzles**, while keeping **10–15 mins/day** for quick arithmetic + 2–3 mixed word problems to retain this week’s skills. If you tell me which of these (ages, mixtures, numbers) feels hardest, I can suggest extra targeted drills for that subtopic.
