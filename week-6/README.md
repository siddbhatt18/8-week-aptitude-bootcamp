Here is your **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 6**, focused on:

- **Logical Reasoning (LR)**: linear & circular arrangements, basic puzzles, simple selection/grouping  
- Ongoing light **Quant/DI revision** (so earlier weeks don’t fade)  
- Building habits of drawing clean diagrams and reasoning step-by-step

Assume ~**2.5–3 hours/day**. As before:

> Learn concept → See 1–2 guided examples → Try on your own → Timed set → Reflect.

## Day 1 – Linear Seating Arrangements: Basics

**Main goal:** Learn to represent people sitting in a straight line and interpret basic positional statements.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Write in your notebook:

1. **Linear arrangement basics**
   - People/things seated in a row: positions are usually 1, 2, 3, …, n.
   - Two orientations:
     - Everyone facing **north/forward** → positions counted **left to right** normally.  
     - Everyone facing **south/back** → “left/right” are reversed; be careful.

2. Common phrases:
   - “X is to the left of Y”  
   - “X is to the right of Y”  
   - “X sits between Y and Z”  
   - “X is second to the left of Y”  
   - “X is at one of the ends”  

3. Basic approach:
   - Draw boxes for positions (e.g., 1–7).  
   - Place fixed positions first (like ends, “third from left”).  
   - Then apply relative constraints slowly, one by one.  
   - Use pencil or erasable pen; be ready to redraw.

### 2. Guided Examples (25–30 min)

Work through 2 simple, fully-written examples.

Example Set 1 (5–6 people):
- Example statement:
  - “A, B, C, D, E are sitting in a row facing north.  
     - B is to the immediate right of C.  
     - A is at one of the ends.  
     - D is between C and E.  
     - E is not at the right end.  
    Find the arrangement and answer: who is at the left end? who sits between B and E? etc.”
- Walk through:
  - Draw 5 positions.  
  - Try placing A at left end first; see if arrangement works.  
  - If contradiction, try right end.  
  - Fill in each condition, step-by-step.

Example Set 2 (7 people; “second to left/right”)
- Practice understanding:
  - “X is third to the right of Y” = if Y is at position i, X is at i+3 (when facing north).

Write your full thought process, not just the final answer.

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner (35–45 min)

Solve **3 linear seating sets**, each with 3–5 questions (total ~10–15 Q):

- All sets should be **basic** (5–7 people).
- Conditions:
  - Some “left/right of”,  
  - Some “between”,  
  - Some “at ends”,  
  - Maybe 1–2 with “immediate neighbor” clues.

For each set:
- Spend **up to 5–7 minutes** drawing and solving arrangement.  
- Answer all accompanying questions once the arrangement is clear.

Focus on:
- Neat diagrams.  
- Avoiding random trial & error; reason systematically.

### 4. Quick Quant/DI Revision (15–20 min)

Solve **8–10 short questions** from earlier weeks:

- 3 from Percentages/Ratios.  
- 3 from Averages/P&L or SI/CI.  
- 2–4 from basic DI (table or bar graph).

Keep difficulty easy-moderate. Goal: keep arithmetic and data sense sharp.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:
- Did you struggle more with interpreting words or drawing diagrams?  
- Did you get stuck and erase many times? If yes, think of one thing you’ll try tomorrow:
  - Example: “Always place the strongest/fixed condition first (like ends/center).”

---

## Day 2 – Linear Arrangements: Intermediate Constraints

**Main goal:** Handle more complex constraints (e.g., conditional positions, multiple possible arrangements).

### 1. Concept Learning (20–25 min)

Key ideas:

1. Sometimes there is more than one possible arrangement.  
   - You may have to branch into **Case 1** and **Case 2** and see which works.

2. More complex phrases:
   - “X is **not** at any of the ends.”  
   - “Only one person sits between X and Y.”  
   - “X sits **immediately** to the left of Y.”  
   - “X sits **exactly between** Y and Z.”  
   - “Neither A nor B sits at the ends.”

3. Approach:
   - Translate text into a constraint language:  
     - “Only one person between X and Y” → positions differ by 2.  
   - Try to place X or Y on candidate positions and see if everything fits.

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Work out 2–3 intermediate sets:

Example Set 1:
- 7 people P, Q, R, S, T, U, V in a row, facing north.
- Conditions like:
  - Q sits third to the left of T.  
  - Only one person between T and S.  
  - R is not at any of the ends.  
  - etc.
- Guide:
  - Place T logically, then Q from that.  
  - Consider cases if needed.

Example Set 2:
- Include negative conditions: “X does not sit next to Y”, “Z is not at position 1 or 7” etc.

Write:
- Where you branch into cases.  
- How you discard a case when a condition can’t be satisfied.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (40–45 min)

Solve **3–4 linear arrangement sets**, each with 4–6 questions (total ~15–18 Q):

- 1–2 sets with 6–7 people, several constraints, maybe requiring cases.  
- Questions ask:
  - Who is at ends?  
  - Position of some person from left.  
  - Who sits between X and Y?  
  - “Which of the following could be true/false?”

Guidelines:
- Spend **7–10 minutes per set**.  
- If stuck, clearly write “Case 1: place X here”, “Case 2: place X there” and see.

### 4. Short Timed Set (10–15 min)

Pick **1 linear arrangement set** (4–5 Q):

- Set timer for **10–12 minutes**.  
- Try to complete arrangement + all questions within time.

Afterwards:
- Note if you panicked or misread any conditions due to time pressure.

### 5. Quick Quant Revision (10–15 min)

- 5 small arithmetic questions: mixture of percentages, averages, or P&L.  
- 2–3 very short number system/TSD questions.

---

## Day 3 – Circular Arrangements: Basics

**Main goal:** Understand circular seating and the difference from linear arrangements.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Important differences from linear:

1. In a circle, there is no absolute “start” position.  
   - So we usually **fix one person’s position** (e.g., put A at top) to break rotational symmetry.

2. Facing direction:
   - If all face **center**, then:
     - Person’s **left** is anti-clockwise direction.  
     - Person’s **right** is clockwise direction.
   - If all face **outwards**, left/right reverse.

3. Common phrases:
   - “X sits immediate left of Y” → adjacent in specified direction.  
   - “X is second to the right of Y” → there is 1 person between them on that side.  
   - “X is between Y and Z” (on the circle).

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Example Set 1 (facing center):
- 6 friends A, B, C, D, E, F sitting around a circular table, all facing center.  
- Statements like:
  - C is to the immediate right of A.  
  - E is between B and D.  
  - F is second to the left of B.  
- Work through:
  - Fix A at the top.  
  - Place C to A’s right (clockwise).  
  - Step-by-step place others.

Example Set 2 (practice left/right):
- Show that for “facing centre”, if A is at top (position 12 o’clock):
  - Right = clockwise, left = anticlockwise.  
- Pose a couple of “who sits to immediate left/right of X” questions once arrangement is drawn.

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner (35–45 min)

Solve **3 circular arrangement sets** (4–5 questions each, total ~12–15 Q):

- All with people facing **center** initially.  
- 5–8 people per set.  
- Simple constraints like:
  - X is third to the left of Y.  
  - Z sits between A and B.  
  - W sits opposite to C.

Steps:
- Always draw a circle with positions roughly equally spaced.  
- Fix one person (say A) at the top to define a starting reference.  
- Mark directions: arrow for clockwise & anticlockwise as right/left.

### 4. Quick Arithmetic/DI Revision (15–20 min)

- 6–8 small questions:
  - 2 from percentages/ratios (for DI).  
  - 2 from averages or P&L.  
  - 2–4 from DI (preferably a tiny single-table or bar graph with 3–4 Q).

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Note:
- Did you get left/right reversed at any point?  
- Do you consistently fix one reference person (like A) before starting?  
- Do circular arrangements feel conceptually harder than linear?

---

## Day 4 – Circular Arrangements: Mixed & Slightly Advanced

**Main goal:** Handle more conditions, including outward-facing and “not adjacent” constraints.

### 1. Concept Learning (20–25 min)

Extend your understanding:

1. For people **facing outward**:
   - Directions flip:  
     - From viewpoint facing outwards, right/left relative to center is reversed.  
   - A simple hack: draw arrows showing which way they face and reason accordingly.

2. More complex constraints:
   - “X is not adjacent to Y or Z.”  
   - “Exactly two persons sit between X and Y.”  
   - “X sits **immediately** between Y and Z” (means they are adjacent with X in middle).

3. Case handling:
   - As with lines, sometimes you must split into cases (X here vs X there) and test conditions.

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Example Set 1 (basic outward facing):
- 6 people facing outward, with conditions like:
  - B is second to the right of A.  
  - D is immediate neighbor of both B and E.  
  - etc.
- Walk through:
  - Clearly mark each person’s facing direction.  
  - Determine right/left accordingly.

Example Set 2 (multiple constraints):
- 7–8 people, conditions with:
  - “exactly two between X and Y.”  
  - Some negative constraints: “X does not sit next to A or B.”

Write at least one example where you consider **Case 1 & Case 2** before finalizing.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (40–45 min)

Solve **3–4 circular arrangement sets** (~15–18 Q):

- Some with all facing center.  
- At least 1 with all facing outward.  
- If available, 1 with mixed facing directions (some inwards, some outwards) – these are tougher; keep it optional as a challenge.

Spend about **8–10 minutes per set**:
- Draw clearly.  
- Don’t hesitate to start over if you detect a contradiction.

### 4. Short Timed Set (10–15 min)

Choose **1 circular arrangement set (4–5 Q)**:

- Timer: **10–12 minutes**.  
- Aim to complete arrangement & answer questions within time.

After:
- Note main cause of slowdown: confusion about directions or too many cases?

### 5. Light Quant Revision (10–15 min)

- 5–7 short questions:
  - 2–3 from Number Systems (LCM/HCF, factors).  
  - 2 from SI/CI or P&L.  
  - 1–2 from TSD/Time & Work.

---

## Day 5 – Selection & Grouping Puzzles (Basic Combinatorial Logic)

**Main goal:** Solve simple team-selection and grouping puzzles using logical counting, not heavy formulas.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Important ideas:

1. Selection vs arrangement:
   - Here, mostly selection: “Choose a committee of 3 from 5 boys and 4 girls” type.  
   - Focus: understanding conditions like
     - “At least one girl”,  
     - “A and B cannot be together”,  
     - “C must be included”.

2. Approach:
   - Start with **unrestricted selection** (basic counting, sometimes using simple combinations or reasoning).  
   - Then **apply conditions**:
     - If “at least one girl” → total ways – ways with no girls.  
     - If “A and B cannot be together” → total ways – ways where both A and B are in.

3. For now, keep math light:
   - For small numbers, **explicitly list possibilities** if needed (this also builds intuition).

### 2. Guided Examples (20–25 min)

Work 4–5 example puzzles:

1. From 3 boys (B1,B2,B3) and 2 girls (G1,G2), how many 3-person teams can be formed?  
   - Count systematically.

2. From 4 people A,B,C,D, how many 2-person teams where:
   - A and B are not together.  
   - C must be included.

3. Puzzle-style:
   - “In a group of 5 friends A,B,C,D,E, a team of 3 is to be chosen.  
     - A refuses to work with B.  
     - C must be in the team.  
     How many different teams are possible?”

Write:
- Total combinations first.  
- Then apply “conditions” by subtracting invalid ones.

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner to Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **10–15 selection/grouping puzzles**:

- 5–7 simple selection count problems.  
- 5–8 puzzle-style with conditions (“cannot be together”, “must be included”, “at least one of…” etc.).

Focus:
- Thinking in **cases** (Case 1: C included; Case 2: not included, etc.).  
- Avoid advanced permutation/combination formulas if they confuse you; use logic and small enumerations.

### 4. Short LR Mixed Set (15–20 min)

Solve **1–2 small LR sets** (not just selection; maybe a short arrangement or simple puzzle) with a **15–20 minute** timer.

Goal:
- Practice switching between types while reasoning clearly.

### 5. Quick Arithmetic/DI Revision (10–15 min)

- 6–8 fast questions:
  - 2 from averages.  
  - 2 from P&L or SI/CI.  
  - 2–4 from a small DI set (table or bar, 3–4 Q).

---

## Day 6 – Mixed LR Practice: Line + Circle + Groups

**Main goal:** Integrate LR types and deepen speed and clarity.

### 1. Short Review (15–20 min)

Without looking, write down:

- Steps you follow for a **linear arrangement** set.  
- Steps for a **circular** set (what you fix first, direction).  
- How you think for **selection** puzzles (cases, subtract invalids).

Then check notes and correct.

### 2. Mixed LR Set 1 – Untimed (35–40 min)

Solve **3 LR sets**:

- 1 linear arrangement (6–8 persons).  
- 1 circular arrangement.  
- 1 selection/grouping puzzle set (multi-question or 2–3 separate problems).

Total Q: ~12–15.

Work slowly and carefully:
- Draw diagrams.  
- Use cases when needed.  
- Annotate conditions (tick them off as you use them).

### 3. Mixed LR Set 2 – Timed (25–30 min)

Pick another **2 LR sets** (~8–10 Q total):

- 1 linear or circular arrangement.  
- 1 grouping/selection puzzle or small logic puzzle (like “who lives on which floor”, etc., if available).

Set a **25–30 min** timer:
- Try to complete both sets within time.  
- Skip any set that becomes a time sink after 10–12 minutes and move to the other.

### 4. Light Quant/DI Revision (15–20 min)

Do **8–10 questions**:

- 3–4 from DI (any type).  
- 2 from Time & Work or TSD.  
- 2–3 from percentages/P&L or SI/CI.

Keep focus on accuracy with moderate speed.

### 5. Error Analysis & Reflection (15–20 min)

From today’s LR sets:

- Identify **3 questions** you struggled with most.  
- For each:
  - What type was it?  
  - Where did you get stuck (understanding, diagram, branching)?  
  - After seeing/deriving the correct solution, what key idea unlocked it?

Write 3 short “lessons learned” you will remember for future LR sets.

---

## Day 7 – Week 6 LR Mini Mock + Consolidation

**Main goal:** Test LR performance under near-exam conditions plus keep Quant/DI alive.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

Solve **3–4 very easy** questions:

- 1 linear seating question (single Q or tiny set).  
- 1 circular question.  
- 1 simple selection/counting puzzle.  
- 1 small arithmetic/DI question.

This is just to get your brain into diagram + logic mode.

### 2. Week 6 LR Mini Mock (45–50 min)

Prepare/choose:

- **LR Sets (20 Q total)**  
  - 2 linear arrangement sets (4–5 Q each).  
  - 1 circular arrangement set (4–5 Q).  
  - 1 selection/grouping / simple puzzle set (4–6 Q).

- **Quant/DI (5 Q)**  
  - 2 from DI (any type).  
  - 1 from Percentages/Averages.  
  - 1 from P&L/SI/CI.  
  - 1 from TSD or Time & Work.

Total: **25 questions.**

Rules:

- Time limit: **45–50 minutes**, single sitting.  
- No checking solutions until the end.  
- Use pen, paper, no distractions.

Strategy:

- Quickly scan all 4 LR sets (5–10 sec each) and decide which seems easiest.  
- Start with your strongest type (e.g., linear).  
- If a set becomes messy with too many cases, mark it and switch to another, then come back later.

### 3. Analysis (35–45 min)

After test:

1. Mark:
   - Correct, wrong, unattempted.

2. Compute:
   - Attempted Qs.  
   - Correct answers.  
   - Accuracy = correct / attempted.

3. Classify mistakes:
   - **LR understanding/diagram issues**:
     - Misinterpreted “left/right” or “between” conditions.  
     - Missed a condition entirely.
   - **Case-handling mistakes**:
     - Did not consider a valid case.  
     - Kept a wrong case too long.
   - **Time issues**:
     - Spent >10–12 min on one set, had to rush others.

4. Re-solve:
   - For each wrong/half-solved LR set, redraw diagram from scratch and do it cleaner.  
   - If still unclear, consult solution and summarize the key pattern (e.g., “Fix this person first because their position is most constrained”).

5. Maintain a **“Logic Mistake Log”**:
   - For each notable error, note:
     - Set type (linear/circle/grouping).  
     - Specific confusion.  
     - One rule to avoid it:
       - “Always write who is facing where before deciding left/right.”  
       - “Tick off each condition as it’s satisfied.”

### 4. Weekly Reflection (10–15 min)

Write answers to:

1. How comfortable (1–10) am I with:
   - Linear arrangements  
   - Circular arrangements  
   - Selection/grouping puzzles  

2. What LR type consistently slows me down the most?  
3. What specific daily/weekly practice will I keep doing to improve LR?
   - e.g., “3 LR sets (2 easy, 1 moderate) every other day”,  
   - “1 timed LR set (15 min) each day before mocks.”

4. How is my **overall stamina** now for combined LR + Quant/DI work?

This wraps up Week 6 and sets you up well for Week 7 (Verbal Ability + basic Critical Reasoning), with your logical reasoning muscles now trained to handle arrangements and structured puzzles.

If you want next, I can design a **Week 7 Day 1–7 plan** focusing on Reading Comprehension, Grammar/Sentence Correction, and basic Critical Reasoning while continuing short daily Quant/LR refresh.
