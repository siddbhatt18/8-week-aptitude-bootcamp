# 📚 WEEK 6: Blood Relations & Coding-Decoding - Detailed Daily Plan

## 🗓️ **DAY 1 (Monday): Blood Relations Fundamentals**
**Total Time: 3 hours**

### 🌅 **Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Basic Blood Relations & Family Trees**

**Core Concepts:**
```
FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS:
Generation 0 (Same):
- Brother/Sister (Siblings)
- Husband/Wife (Spouse)
- Brother-in-law/Sister-in-law

Generation +1 (Above):
- Father/Mother (Parents)
- Uncle/Aunt (Parent's siblings)
- Father-in-law/Mother-in-law

Generation -1 (Below):
- Son/Daughter (Children)
- Nephew/Niece (Sibling's children)
- Son-in-law/Daughter-in-law

Generation +2/-2:
- Grandfather/Grandmother
- Grandson/Granddaughter

SYMBOLS FOR DIAGRAMS:
□ = Male
○ = Female
? = Unknown gender
— = Marriage connection
| = Parent-child connection
... = Sibling connection
```

**Key Rules:**
```
1. GENDER DETERMINATION:
   - Father's/Mother's son = Male
   - Someone's wife/daughter = Female
   - Sibling can be either gender

2. ONLY CHILD:
   - Father's only son = No brothers
   - Parent's only child = No siblings

3. RELATIONSHIP CHAINS:
   - A's father's brother = Uncle
   - A's mother's sister = Aunt
   - A's sister's son = Nephew

4. IN-LAW RELATIONS:
   - Spouse's family members
   - Sibling's spouse
   - Child's spouse
```

#### **9:30 - 10:30 AM: Practice Problems**

**Problem Set 1 (Basic Relations):**

1. **Simple Direct:**
   A is B's sister. C is B's mother. D is C's father. How is A related to D?
   
   **Solution:**
   ```
   D (Grandfather)
   |
   C (Mother)
   |
   ├─A (Female)──B
   ```
   Answer: A is D's granddaughter

2. **Only Child Concept:**
   Pointing to a man, woman says "His mother is my father's only daughter." How is woman related to man?
   
   **Analysis:**
   - My father's only daughter = Me (woman)
   - His mother = Me
   - Answer: Woman is man's mother

3. **Gender Determination:**
   P is Q's brother. R is Q's father. S is R's father. How is P related to S?
   
   **Solution:**
   - P is male (brother)
   - P is R's son
   - P is S's grandson
   Answer: Grandson

4. **In-law Relations:**
   A is married to B. C is B's sister. D is A's brother. How is C related to D?
   
   **Diagram:**
   ```
   D───...───A === B───...───C
   (brother) (married) (sister)
   ```
   Answer: C is D's sister-in-law

5. **Chain Relations:**
   X's mother is the only daughter of Y's father. How is Y related to X?
   
   **Analysis:**
   - Y's father's only daughter = Y (if Y is female) or Y's sister
   - But "only daughter" means Y must be male
   - Y's sister = X's mother
   Answer: Y is X's maternal uncle

**Practice 15 more basic problems**

### 🌆 **Evening Session (1.5 hours)**

#### **6:00 - 6:30 PM: Family Tree Construction**
**Advanced Techniques:**
```
TREE BUILDING STEPS:
1. Start with the speaker/reference person
2. Add relationships one by one
3. Mark gender immediately when known
4. Use generation levels
5. Verify consistency

COMMON PATTERNS:
- Circular definitions (A is B's..., B is C's..., C is A's...)
- Missing links (find intermediate person)
- Minimum members (smallest family satisfying conditions)
```

#### **6:30 - 7:30 PM: Timed Practice**

#### **9:00 - 9:30 AM: Concept Learning**
**Topic: Advanced Blood Relations Patterns**

**Complex Scenarios:**
```
1. PUZZLE-BASED RELATIONS:
   - Multiple people with interconnections
   - Finding specific relationships
   - Hidden family members

2. CODED BLOOD RELATIONS:
   - Relations given in code
   - Example: A+B means A is father of B
   - Decode and find relationships

3. MINIMUM/MAXIMUM MEMBERS:
   - Find smallest family satisfying conditions
   - Find maximum possible members

4. POINTING/PHOTOGRAPH PROBLEMS:
   - "Pointing to a photograph..."
   - Complex nested statements
   - Self-referential statements

5. MIXED GENDER GROUPS:
   - Statements don't specify gender
   - Multiple possibilities
   - Need systematic exploration
```

**Advanced Solving Strategies:**
```
For Complex Problems:
1. ASSUMPTION METHOD:
   - Assume you are the person speaking
   - Build relations from your perspective
   - Easier to track relationships

2. GENERATION MAPPING:
   - Mark generation levels clearly
   - G2: Grandparents
   - G1: Parents
   - G0: Self/Siblings
   - G-1: Children

3. POSSIBILITY TREE:
   - When gender unknown
   - Branch out possibilities
   - Eliminate contradictions
```

1. **Photo Problem:**
   Looking at portrait, man says "Brothers and sisters I have none, but this man's father is my father's son." Who is in portrait?
   
   **Analysis:**
   - I have no siblings
   - My father's son = Me (only child)
   - This man's father = Me
   Answer: Man's son in portrait

2. **Coded Relations:**
   If A × B means A is mother of B
   A – B means A is brother of B  
   A + B means A is father of B
   A ÷ B means A is sister of B
   
   Then in P × Q + R ÷ S, how is P related to S?
   
   **Decode:**
   - P is mother of Q
   - Q is father of R
   - R is sister of S
   - P is S's grandmother

3. **Minimum Members:**
   A family has:
   - Two fathers
   - Two mothers
   - Two sons
   - Two daughters
   - One husband
   - One wife
   Find minimum members.
   
   **Solution:**
   Minimum = 4 (Grandfather, Grandmother, Father, Daughter)

4. **Complex Chain:**
   A and B are married couple. X and Y are brothers. X is brother of A. How is Y related to B?
   
   **Diagram:**
   ```
   X───...───A === B
   |         (married)
   ...
   |
   Y
   ```
   Answer: Y is B's brother-in-law

5. **Multi-Generation:**
   In a family of 8:
   - P is Q's son
   - R is P's uncle
   - S is R's mother
   - T is S's husband
   - U is Q's mother
