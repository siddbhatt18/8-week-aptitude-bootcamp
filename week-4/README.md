## Day 1 – Time & Work: Core Idea (Work per Day)

**Main goal:** Understand “work rate” and how to combine individual rates.

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

Write these in your notebook:

1. **Basic idea**
   - Think in terms of **“fraction of work done per unit time”**.
   - If A alone can complete a job in **T days**, then:
     - A’s rate = `1/T` work per day.

2. **Combined work**
   - If A takes `a` days, B takes `b` days:
     - A’s rate = `1/a`, B’s rate = `1/b`
     - Combined rate = `1/a + 1/b` work/day
     - Time together to finish = `1 / (1/a + 1/b) = ab / (a + b)`

3. **General principle**
   - Work done = Rate × Time  
   - Total work can be considered as **1 unit of work** or **LCM of times** (sometimes helpful for integer units).

### 2. Guided Examples (15–20 min)

Solve and write all steps:

1. A alone can finish a work in 10 days. How much work does A do in 1 day? In 5 days?  
2. A can do a work in 10 days, B in 15 days. How long together?  
3. A can do a work in 6 days, B in 12 days, C in 4 days. How long for A+B+C together?  
4. A alone does work in 8 days, B alone in 24 days. How many days for A+B?

Emphasize:
- Writing rates explicitly.  
- Using fraction language (“A does 1/10th of work per day”).

### 3. Independent Practice – Beginner (35–45 min)

Solve **15–20 problems**:

- 8–10: A & B type (given individual times, find time together).  
- 5–7: A+B+C type (3 workers).  
- 2–3: Quick variations:  
  - “If A does 1/4 of work in 3 days, how many days to finish alone?”

Rules for yourself:
- Max **2.5 minutes** per question.  
- Always write:
  - Rate of each worker.  
  - Combined rate.  
  - Time = Work / Rate (assuming total work = 1).

### 4. Small Drill: Rate Intuition (10–15 min)

Make a table of **10 rows**:

Columns:
- Time to finish alone (days): e.g., 5, 10, 8, 12, 20...  
- Rate (fraction per day): 1/5, 1/10, etc.

Then:
- For pairs (5 & 10), (6 & 12), (8 & 24), quickly compute combined time.

Aim: finish in **10–15 minutes**.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:
- Is the “rate = 1/time” idea clear?  
- Do you ever forget to **add rates** when combining workers?

---

## Day 2 – Time & Work: “Starts later / Leaves early” & Efficiency

**Main goal:** Solve multi-phase work problems and understand efficiency comparisons.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Key ideas:

1. **Partial work / multi-phase**
   - If A works alone for x days, then A+B together:
     - Work done by A in x days = `x × (1/a)`  
     - Remaining work = `1 – that amount`  
     - Remaining time = remaining work / combined rate.

2. **Efficiency**
   - If A is “twice as efficient” as B:
     - A’s rate = 2k, B’s rate = k for some k.  
     - If B takes b days, A takes b/2 days.

3. Sometimes assuming **total work = LCM** of times (e.g., 60 units) makes integers easier.

### 2. Guided Examples (20 min)

Solve 6–8 examples:

1. A can finish work in 12 days; B in 16 days. A works alone for 4 days, then A+B finish together. How many total days?  
2. A can do work in 10 days, B in 15 days. They work together for 3 days. What fraction remains?  
3. A is twice as efficient as B. Together they finish work in 12 days. How long would A and B take individually?  
4. A and B can do a piece of work in 8 days. B alone can do it in 24 days. How many days for A alone?

Pay attention to:
- Breaking the work into parts.  
- Using “efficiency” as relative rate.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **15 problems**:

- 7–8 with “A works alone for x days, then B joins” or vice versa.  
- 3–4 with people leaving/entering midway.  
- 3–4 efficiency-based (one is n times efficient as another).

Try two styles:
- Total work = 1 unit (fractions).  
- Total work = LCM of times (integer units).  
See which feels more natural to you.

### 4. Challenge Problems (15–20 min)

Pick **3–5 harder PYQ-type questions**, for example:

1. A can complete a work in 15 days, B in 20 days. They work together for 4 days, then A leaves. B finishes the rest in how many days?  
2. A, B, C together can do a job in 5 days. A alone takes 15 days, B alone 20 days. How long will C alone take?  
3. A and B can do a work in 12 days. B and C in 16 days. C and A in 24 days. How long for all three together? (classic system of equations type.)

Spend up to **4 min** per question; write down all your thoughts before checking solutions.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Note:
- Are you comfortable splitting work into phases and fractions?  
- Do multi-person problems scare you less now?

---

## Day 3 – Pipes & Cisterns (Time & Work in Disguise)

**Main goal:** See pipes/tanks as time & work problems with positive and negative rates.

### 1. Concept Learning (25–30 min)

Understand:

1. **Analogy**
   - Tank = “Work”  
   - Filling pipe = worker with positive rate  
   - Leakage/emptying pipe = negative rate (removes work)

2. If a pipe fills a tank in T hours:
   - Rate = `1/T` tank per hour.

3. Combined rate:
   - Example: A fills in 6 h, B fills in 8 h, C empties in 12 h:
     - A: +1/6, B: +1/8, C: –1/12  
     - Net rate = 1/6 + 1/8 – 1/12

4. Time to fill or empty:
   - `Time = 1 / Net rate` (if net positive, tank fills; if negative, tank empties).

### 2. Guided Examples (20 min)

Solve 6–8 examples:

1. Pipe A fills tank in 6 h; Pipe B in 8 h. Time together?  
2. A fills in 4 h; B fills in 6 h; C empties in 12 h. Time to fill if all opened together?  
3. A can fill in 10 h. A is opened for 2 h alone, then B (fills in 5 h) is also opened. Total time?  
4. A fills in 15 h. Because of a leak, it takes 20 h. How long would leak alone take to empty a full tank?

Be explicit:
- Label rates as + or –.  
- Always confirm if net is filling or emptying.

### 3. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **15 problems**:

- 6–7 simple two-pipe fill problems.  
- 5–6 three-pipe problems (2 fill, 1 empty).  
- 2–3 where pipes open/close at different times (phased).

Try both fraction and “LCM as total capacity” methods.

### 4. Short Challenge Set (15–20 min)

Choose **3–4 trickier problems**, patterns like:

1. A tank is half full. Pipe A can fill in 6 h; pipe B alone can fill in 8 h. If A is opened for 2 h and then B is also opened, how long until full?  
2. A leak drains a tank in x hours; a filling pipe fills it in y hours. Together they fill in z hours. Find x or y.

Give yourself **4–5 min** per question.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:
- Are you seeing pipes questions as “just time & work” now?  
- Do you handle negative rates correctly?

## Day 4 – Number Systems I: Divisibility, Factors, LCM & HCF

**Main goal:** Build basic number sense around divisibility and multiples.

### 1. Concept Learning – Divisibility (20–25 min)

Note and memorize divisibility rules for:

- By 2: last digit even.  
- By 3: sum of digits divisible by 3.  
- By 4: last 2 digits divisible by 4.  
- By 5: last digit 0 or 5.  
- By 6: divisible by 2 and 3.  
- By 8: last 3 digits divisible by 8.  
- By 9: sum of digits divisible by 9.  
- By 11: (sum of digits in odd positions – sum of digits in even positions) divisible by 11.

Practice mentally on random numbers.

### 2. Concept Learning – LCM & HCF (20–25 min)

1. **Prime factorization method**:
   - Example: 12 = 2² × 3; 18 = 2 × 3².
2. **HCF (GCD)**:
   - Take common prime factors with **minimum** powers.
3. **LCM**:
   - Take all prime factors with **maximum** powers.

Examples:
- HCF(12, 18) = 2¹ × 3¹ = 6  
- LCM(12, 18) = 2² × 3² = 36  

Also understand basic word usage:
- LCM used for events repeating at intervals.  
- HCF used to divide things into equal groups/parts.

### 3. Guided Examples (20 min)

Solve about 8 problems:

1. Check divisibility of given numbers by 2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11 (choose various).  
2. Find LCM and HCF of simple pairs: (12,18), (20,30), (16,24).  
3. Word problem: “Bells ring every 4, 6, 8 min. If they ring together now, after how many minutes again?” (LCM).  
4. “What is the greatest length that can exactly measure 30 m, 45 m, 60 m?” (HCF).

### 4. Independent Practice – Beginner to Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **15–20 questions**:

- 6–8 divisibility checks and small factorization questions.  
- 6–8 LCM/HCF direct calculation.  
- 3–4 word problems (bells, traffic lights, cutting rods into equal pieces, etc.).

Pay attention:
- Always write prime factorization carefully.  
- Decide whether question needs LCM or HCF.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Note:
- Which divisibility rule do you still hesitate about (maybe 8 or 11)?  
- Are you reliably choosing between LCM vs HCF for word problems?

## Day 5 – Number Systems II: Factors, Remainders, Trailing Zeros

**Main goal:** Understand factors, counting them, and basic remainder/trailing-zero problems.

### 1. Concept Learning – Factors & Counting (20–25 min)

1. **Prime factorization of a number n:**
   - `n = p₁^a × p₂^b × ...`
2. **Total number of positive factors**:
   - `(a + 1)(b + 1)...`
   - Example: 12 = 2² × 3¹ → factors = (2+1)(1+1) = 3×2 = 6.

3. **Number of even factors / odd factors**:
   - Even factors: must include factor 2.  
   - Odd factors: exclude 2 from factorization.

### 2. Concept Learning – Trailing Zeros & Remainders (20–25 min)

1. **Trailing zeros in factorial n!**
   - Each trailing zero comes from factor 10 = 2×5.  
   - Usually 2s plenty, so count 5s.  
   - Formula:
     - Zeros in n! = ⌊n/5⌋ + ⌊n/25⌋ + ⌊n/125⌋ + ...

2. **Basic remainders using modular arithmetic ideas (light)**
   - Remainder when dividing a number by m.  
   - Use patterns in powers:
     - e.g., `2^1 mod 3 = 2`, `2^2 mod 3 = 1`, `2^3 mod 3 = 2` → repeats.
   - For simple ones, you can expand or notice patterns.

### 3. Guided Examples (20 min)

Solve 8–10 examples:

1. Find number of factors of 36 = 2² × 3² → (2+1)(2+1)=9.  
2. Find number of factors of 72 = 2³ × 3².  
3. Find trailing zeros in:
   - 10!, 25!, 100!  
4. Find remainder when:
   - 257 is divided by 9 (use digit sum).  
   - 2⁵ is divided by 5.  
   - 3⁴ is divided by 7 (write pattern if needed).

### 4. Independent Practice – Intermediate (35–45 min)

Solve **15–18 problems**:

- 6–8 factor count questions (some include “even factors” or “odd factors”).  
- 4–6 trailing zeros of n! for various n.  
- 4–6 simple remainder questions (division by 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, maybe a couple with powers).

Try:
- Always prime factorize first.  
- For remainders, think about patterns instead of full expansion.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Write:
- Are you comfortable using the factors formula `(a+1)(b+1)...`?  
- Does the idea of “counting factors of 5 for trailing zeros” feel intuitive now?

---

## Day 6 – Mixed Practice: Time & Work + Pipes + Number Systems

**Main goal:** Integrate ideas and build speed on mixed questions.

### 1. Quick Revision (20–25 min)

From memory, write on a page:

- Time & work basics: rate = 1/time, combined rates, multi-phase logic.  
- Pipes: positive/negative rates, analogy with time & work.  
- Number system essentials:
  - Divisibility rules.  
  - LCM/HCF approach.  
  - Factor count formula.  
  - Trailing zeros formula.

Then check with notes and correct errors.

### 2. Mixed Problem Set 1 – Untimed (35–40 min)

Solve **18–20 problems**:

- 6–7 Time & Work (including at least 2 multi-phase, 1 efficiency-style).  
- 4–5 Pipes & Cisterns (mix of simple and with leak).  
- 4–5 Number System (LCM/HCF, factors, trailing zeros, basic remainders).  
- Optional 2–3 quick ones from previous weeks (percentages or SI/CI) to stay fresh.

For each:
- Label type: “TW / Pipes / LCM/HCF / Factors / Rem” etc.  
- Be systematic with steps, don’t skip writing rates/factorizations.

### 3. Mixed Problem Set 2 – Timed (25–30 min)

Take another **10–12 questions** and set a **25–30 min** timer.

- Try to keep average **2–2.5 minutes** per question.  
- Skip any question that goes beyond 3.5–4 minutes on first attempt; circle it.

After the timer:
- Mark which questions were slow or incorrect.

### 4. Error Review (20–25 min)

For each wrong/slow question:

1. Identify reason:
   - Concept misunderstanding  
   - Calculation mistake  
   - Misreading  
   - Poor strategy (e.g., starting with a long method)

2. Re-solve the problem slowly and cleanly.  
3. If conceptually weak (e.g., pipes with leak, LCM word problem), immediately solve **2 more similar problems**.

### 5. Reflection (10 min)

Note:
- Which topic among Time & Work, Pipes, LCM/HCF, Factors, Remainders feels weakest?  
- One micro-plan for tomorrow (e.g., “Do 5 more LCM word problems before mock”).

## Day 7 – Week 4 Mini Mock + Consolidation

**Main goal:** Test yourself on Week 4 topics in a near-exam setting.

### 1. Light Warm-up (10–15 min)

Solve 4–5 easy questions:

- 1 basic Time & Work  
- 1 Pipes  
- 1 LCM/HCF  
- 1 trailing zeros or factor count  
- 1 simple remainder

This is just to get into problem-solving mode.

### 2. Week 4 Mini Mock (45–50 min)

Prepare **25 questions**:

- **Time & Work (9 Q)**  
  - 4 basic (2-person work).  
  - 3 multi-phase (start/stop at different times).  
  - 2 efficiency/3-person system-type.
- **Pipes & Cisterns (6 Q)**  
  - 3 simple fill (2 pipes).  
  - 2 including a leak.  
  - 1 multi-phase (pipes opened/closed at different times).
- **Number Systems (10 Q)**  
  - 3 divisibility / LCM-HCF basics.  
  - 3 factor count / trailing zeros.  
  - 4 remainder / small power pattern questions.

Rules:
- Time limit: **45–50 minutes**, continuous.  
- No solutions mid-way.  
- Use only allowed tools (preferably no calculator, unless your exam allows it).

Strategy:
- Start with your strongest section (e.g., Time & Work).  
- Don’t spend more than ~3 minutes on a single question in first pass.  
- Mark unclear ones, return if time remains.

### 3. Mock Analysis (35–45 min)

Afterwards:

1. Mark:
   - Correct, wrong, unattempted.

2. Compute:
   - Attempted total.  
   - Correct count.  
   - Accuracy = correct / attempted.

3. Categorize errors:
   - Concept gaps:
     - e.g., “Got Time & Work equations wrong”, “Confused HCF with LCM”.  
   - Calculation:
     - Mistakes in multiplication, fraction arithmetic.  
   - Reading:
     - Misunderstood who started/left when, or what “exact measure” meant.  
   - Strategy:
     - Spent too long on one hard question.

4. For each **wrong or skipped** question:
   - Reattempt with full steps.  
   - If still confused, read solution carefully.  
   - Summarize key idea in **one line** in your notebook (e.g., “When everyone’s total time is given pairwise, set up 3 equations”).

5. Build a “Week 4 mistake sheet”:
   - List 5–8 representative hard or mistaken problems with short notes.

### 4. Weekly Reflection (10–15 min)

Answer in writing:

1. How comfortable am I now with:
   - Time & Work (rate concept, multi-phase problems)?  
   - Pipes & Cisterns (positive/negative rates)?  
   - Number Systems (LCM/HCF, factors, zeros, basic remainders)?

2. Where did I lose most marks/time in the mini mock?

3. Plan to maintain Week 4 topics while moving to Week 5:
   - e.g., “Daily 10-min drill: 2 Time & Work + 2 Number System problems.”

4. Self-score (1–10) on:
   - Concept understanding.  
   - Speed & accuracy.  
   - Test stamina.

This closes Week 4 and positions you well to move into Week 5 (Data Interpretation + Revision of Arithmetic).

If you’d like, I can next outline a **Week 5 Day 1–7 plan** focusing on DI, along with structured daily practice that mixes in revision of Weeks 1–4.
