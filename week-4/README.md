Here is a structured **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 4**, focused on:

- Time, Speed & Distance (TSD)  
- Relative Speed  
- Trains  
- Boats & Streams  

Target: **~1.5–2.5 hours per day**. Adjust as needed.

---

## Core Ideas for Week 4

Keep these in mind all week:

- **Distance = Speed × Time**  
- **Speed = Distance / Time**  
- **Time = Distance / Speed**

- Unit conversions:
  - km/hr → m/s: multiply by **5/18**
  - m/s → km/hr: multiply by **18/5**

- **Relative speed**:
  - Same direction: |v₁ – v₂|  
  - Opposite direction: v₁ + v₂  

- Trains: distance covered when crossing = **sum of lengths (where relevant)**.  
- Boats:  
  - Downstream speed = boat speed + stream speed  
  - Upstream speed = boat speed – stream speed  

---

## Day 1 – Basic Time, Speed & Distance (No Tricks)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Basic TSD Relationships**

- Understand and rewrite: D = S × T, S = D / T, T = D / S.  
- Visualize: if speed is constant, distance and time are proportional.

b) **Unit Conversion**

- 36 km/hr = (36 × 1000 m) / (3600 s) = 10 m/s → general factor 5/18.  
- Memorize a few:  
  - 18 km/hr = 5 m/s  
  - 36 km/hr = 10 m/s  
  - 54 km/hr = 15 m/s  
  - 72 km/hr = 20 m/s  

c) **Using Ratios Intuitively**

- If speed ratio is 2:3, then **time ratio** is 3:2 for same distance.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. A car travels 150 km in 3 hours. Find speed.  
2. A person walks at 6 km/hr. How far will he walk in 4 hours?  
3. Find time to cover 100 km at 50 km/hr.  
4. Convert speeds:
   - 36 km/hr to m/s  
   - 54 km/hr to m/s  
   - 10 m/s to km/hr  
   - 15 m/s to km/hr

**Intermediate**

5. A cyclist covers 27 km in 1.5 hours. Find speed.  
6. A train travels at 60 km/hr. How much distance in 40 minutes?  
7. A car travels 90 km at 45 km/hr. How long does it take?

**Advanced (1–2 problems)**

8. A person increases his speed from 40 km/hr to 60 km/hr for a 120 km journey. How much time does he save?  
9. Two cars travel the same distance. The ratio of their speeds is 3:4. If the faster car takes 2 hours, how long does the slower one take?

**Reinforces**

- Comfort with D–S–T relations  
- Unit (km/hr ↔ m/s) conversion  
- Speed–time inverse relationship

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 10 quick TSD questions (basic, numeric).  
- Aim: 12–15 minutes, focus on neat, direct substitutions.

### 4. Short Reflection (5–10 min)

- Note which is harder: unit conversions, fractions in time, or identifying what is given vs what is asked.

---

## Day 2 – Relative Speed & TSD Applications

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Relative Speed Idea**

- Two objects moving:
  - In **opposite directions** → speeds add.  
  - In **same direction** → effective speed = difference.

b) **Meeting / Catch-up Problems**

- Meeting in opposite directions: use (S₁ + S₂) as relative speed.  
- Catch-up from behind (same direction): use |S₁ – S₂|.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. Two people walk towards each other from A and B, 30 km apart, at 4 km/hr and 2 km/hr. When do they meet?  
   - Relative speed = 6 km/hr.

2. Two cyclists start from same point in opposite directions at 10 km/hr and 15 km/hr. How far apart in 2 hours?

**Intermediate**

3. Two cars are 100 km apart, moving towards each other at 40 km/hr and 60 km/hr. Time to meet?  
4. A bus travels at 50 km/hr. A car starts 2 hours later from the same place and chases the bus at 75 km/hr. When will the car catch the bus?  
   - Step 1: find lead distance.  
   - Step 2: use relative speed (75–50).

5. Two trains start from same point in same direction. Train A = 60 km/hr, Train B = 80 km/hr. How long before B is 40 km ahead of A?

**Advanced (1–2 problems)**

6. A man walks at 5 km/hr. A cyclist starts 2 hours after him from same point at 15 km/hr. After how much time from cyclist’s start will he overtake the man, and how far from the start point?  

7. Two runners A and B run around a circular track of 400 m in opposite directions at speeds 6 m/s and 4 m/s. In how many seconds do they meet for the first time?

**Reinforces**

- Setting up relative speed correctly  
- Handling “start later” and “catch up” logic  
- Using distance = relative speed × time

### 3. Speed Drill (10–15 min)

- 6–8 relative speed questions (mix same & opposite direction).  
- Target: 15 minutes, focus on quickly deciding add vs subtract speeds.

### 4. Review (5–10 min)

- Jot down 3 generic patterns for relative speed problems:
  - Opposite direction meeting  
  - Same direction catch-up  
  - Lead distance then catch-up

## Day 3 – Trains: Basics (Crossing a Person / Pole / Platform)

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Distance in Train Problems**

- When a train passes a **standing object** (pole/person/tree):  
  - Distance covered = **length of the train**.  
- When a train passes a **platform/bridge** of length L:  
  - Distance covered = train length + platform length.

b) **Use Correct Units**

- Usually, speed in km/hr → convert to m/s.  
- Lengths in meters; time in seconds.

### 2. Guided Practice (45–60 min)

**Beginner**

1. A train 120 m long passes a man standing on a platform in 8 seconds. Find speed in m/s and km/hr.  
2. A train 150 m long passes a tree in 10 seconds. Find speed.

3. A train 100 m long passes a platform 50 m long in 10 seconds. Find speed.  
   - Distance = 100 + 50.

## Day 4 – Trains: Two Trains, Opposite / Same Direction

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Two Moving Trains**

- Crossing each other:  
  - Opposite directions: relative speed = S₁ + S₂  
  - Same direction: relative speed = |S₁ – S₂|

  - Sum of their lengths.

b) **Order of Steps**

1. Convert both speeds to m/s.

## Day 5 – Boats & Streams: Basic Upstream / Downstream

### 1. Concept Learning (30–40 min)

a) **Definitions**

- Speed of boat in still water = B  
- Speed of stream = S  
- Downstream: with the current → B + S  
- Upstream: against the current → B – S

  - Calculation / unit error

Write a **short corrected solution** or key idea needed. Add toughest ones to your “mistake book”.

### 4. Prepare for Week 5 (5–10 min)

Week 5 will focus on **Data Interpretation (DI)** and **applied percentages & ratios**.

- Note if you still feel weak with:
  - Fractions & mental arithmetic (very important for DI)  
  - Percent changes and ratio comparisons  
- Plan a **short 10–15 min daily revision** of fractions/percentages in Week 5 before DI practice.
