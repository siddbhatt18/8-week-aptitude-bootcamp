Here’s your **Week 4 (Day 1–7) plan**, focused on:

- Mixtures & Alligation  
- Remainders / Modular arithmetic / Last digits  
- Basic Linear Equations / Simple Algebra  

Assume ~1–1.5 hours/day. If you have more, increase practice questions.

Use aptitude sites and filter by:

- “Remainders / Modular arithmetic / Number System”
- “Linear Equations / Algebra”

---

## Day 1 – Mixtures: Simple % and Quantity-Based Problems

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- Basic mixture idea:
  - Final quantity = sum of parts.
  - Final concentration = (quantity of solute / total mixture) × 100.
- Typical scenarios:
  - Milk & water.
  - Solutions with % of a component (e.g., acid, salt).
- No alligation rule yet; just use equations:
  - “Pure milk + water → new % of milk.”

### 2. Guided Practice (30–35 min)
Target: **10–12 beginner problems**.

Problem types:
1. Straight % in mixture:
   - “In a 20 L solution, 30% is alcohol. How many liters of alcohol?”
   - “A 40 L mixture has 25% acid. How much acid is there?”
2. Building a mixture:
   - “How many liters of pure milk must be added to 10 L of 40% milk solution to get a 50% milk solution?”
3. Changing composition:
   - “A 30 L mixture has 70% milk and 30% water. Add 6 L water. What is new % of water?”

**Reinforces**
- Understanding “% of total” in mixture context.
- Comfort equating quantity of component before and after mixing.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 4–5 mixture problems (simple).  
- 3–4 quick % or ratio questions (revision from Weeks 1–3).

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- For each mixture question, explicitly write:
  - “Milk quantity before = …”  
  - “Water quantity before = …”  
  - “Total after = …”
- Note if you confuse total quantity vs component quantity.

## Day 2 – Alligation Rule (Two-Component Mixtures)

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- **Alligation rule** for mixing two components with different concentrations/prices:
  - If you mix strength a and b to get mean m (a > m > b), the ratio is:
    - Quantity at a : Quantity at b = (m – b) : (a – m)
- Applications:
  - Mixing cheap and costly items (e.g., rice at Rs. 20/kg & Rs. 30/kg to get Rs. 26/kg).
  - Mixing high % and low % solution.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **10–12 alligation problems (beginner→intermediate)**.

Problem types:
1. Price-based:
   - “In what ratio must rice at Rs. 20/kg be mixed with rice at Rs. 30/kg so that the mixture costs Rs. 26/kg?”
   - Use alligation:
     - High: 30, Low: 20, Mean: 26 → ratio: (26 – 20):(30 – 26) = 6:4 = 3:2.
2. Percentage-based:
   - “In what ratio must water (0% milk) be mixed with pure milk (100% milk) to get 80% milk?”
3. Quantity calculation:
   - “How many liters of 40% solution must be mixed with 60% solution to get 100 L of 50% solution?”

**Reinforces**
- Fast ratio finding without solving simultaneous equations.
- Linking ratio from alligation to actual quantities.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 4–5 mixture/alligation questions already solved → redo quickly.  
- 3–4 simple percentage/ratio questions.

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Draw the alligation “X” diagram in your notes:
  - Top left = a, top right = b, middle = m, bottom gives ratio.  
- Re-solve 1–2 questions where you mis-set high/low/mean.

## Day 3 – Mixture Replacement (Repeated Dilution)

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- Replacement problems:
  - Remove some quantity, then replace with another (usually water).
  - After n repetitions:
    - Final amount of original substance = Initial amount × (1 – removed/total)^n
- Typical setup:
  - “A container has 40 L milk. 8 L is removed and replaced with water. Process repeated n times…”

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **10–12 intermediate problems**.

Problem types:
1. Single replacement:
   - “40 L milk. Remove 10 L, add water. What fraction of milk now?”
2. Multiple replacements:
   - “A 30 L milk container: 6 L removed and replaced with water, 3 times. How much milk left?”
   - Use: 30 × (1 – 6/30)^3 = 30 × (4/5)^3.
3. Variation:
   - Ask final % of milk or water after n steps.

**Reinforces**
- Recognizing geometric reduction pattern (same fraction removed repeatedly).
- Comfort using the formula without expanding step-by-step.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 4–5 mixture/alligation/replacement problems.  
- 3–4 average or ratio questions (maintain earlier skills).

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- On one small note:
  - “Replacement formula: Final original = Initial × (1 – x/total)^n.”  
- Re-solve one problem **both ways**:
  - Step-by-step (1st, 2nd, 3rd replacement).  
  - Using the formula. Confirm they match.

## Day 4 – Remainders & Modular Arithmetic (Basics)

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- When dividing N by d:
  - Quotient q, remainder r: N = dq + r, 0 ≤ r < d.
- Basic idea of mod:
  - N mod d = remainder when N is divided by d.
- Simple properties:
  - (a + b) mod n = [(a mod n) + (b mod n)] mod n  
  - (a – b) mod n = [(a mod n) – (b mod n)] mod n  
  - (a × b) mod n = [(a mod n) × (b mod n)] mod n

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 beginner problems**.

Problem types:
1. Direct remainder:
   - “Find remainder when 1234 is divided by 7.”
2. Using modular breakdown:
   - “Find remainder of (347 + 596) when divided by 5.”
   - “Find remainder of (25×36) when divided by 7.”
3. Bigger numbers via mod simplification:
   - “Find remainder when 10^5 is divided by 7.” (compute 10 mod 7 first, then powers).
4. Simple pattern:
   - “Find remainder when 2^10 is divided by 5.”

**Reinforces**
- Not doing full division: use modular properties.
- Breaking large expressions into manageable parts.

### 3. Mixed Drill (15–20 min)
- 5–6 remainder questions (small to medium).  
- 2–3 mixture questions (quick).

### 4. Review (10–15 min)
- Write modular properties in notes.  
- For any mistake, explain in a sentence what you should have reduced earlier (e.g., reduce base before taking power).

## Day 5 – Last Digit, Cyclicity & Slightly Harder Remainders

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- Last digit problems:
  - Focus on last digit of base and its **cycle** in powers:
    - e.g., 2^n: 2,4,8,6 → cycle length 4.

  - Recognize repetition when taking powers mod small numbers.
- Typical exam types:
  - Last digit of a^b.
  - Remainder when a large power is divided by single-digit.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)

Problem types:
1. Last digit:
   - “Find the last digit of 7^45.”
     - Cycle of 7: 7,9,3,1 → 4-length → 45 mod 4 = 1 → last digit 7.
2. Big power mod small n:
   - “Find remainder when 3^20 is divided by 7.”
   - Observe cycle of 3^k mod 7.
3. Combination expressions:
   - “Find last digit of (2^15 + 3^12).”

### 1. Concepts (20–25 min)
- Solving 1-variable linear equations:
  - ax + b = c → x = (c – b)/a.
- 2-variable linear equations:
  - ax + by = c, dx + ey = f → solve by elimination/substitution.
- Translating word problems into equations:
  - Ages, numbers, money, ratio-based statements.

### 2. Guided Practice (30–40 min)
Target: **12–15 questions (beginner→intermediate)**.

## Day 7 – Week 4 Mini Mock + Consolidated Revision

### 1. Timed Mini Mock (35–40 min)
Create/choose a test of **20–25 questions** from:

- Mixtures / Alligation / Replacement: 7–9 Q  
- Remainders / Last digit / Basic modular: 6–8 Q  
- Linear Equations / Simple algebraic word problems: 6–8 Q  

Sit for 35–40 minutes uninterrupted:
- First pass: answer all straightforward ones.  
- Second pass: attempt moderate ones; leave any pseudo-hard ones for the very end.

### 2. Mock Review (30–40 min)
For each wrong/guessed/skipped question:
- Tag the cause:
  1. **Concept gap** (didn’t know method).
  2. **Set-up error** (wrong equation, wrong identification of high/low/mean in alligation).
  3. **Arithmetic/speed error**.

Then:
- For (1): re-read that concept (e.g., replacement formula, alligation ratio). Solve 2 similar problems.
- For (2): rewrite the question and restate it in your own words.
- For (3): re-do the arithmetic carefully and see if there’s a shortcut you missed.

### 3. Week 4 Summary Sheet (15–20 min)
On a single sheet/page, write:

- Mixtures:
  - Component quantity = % × total.  
  - Alligation formula and a sample “X” diagram.  
  - Replacement formula: Final original = Initial × (1 – x/total)^n.
- Remainders:
  - Definitions and key mod properties.  
  - Note of 2–3 typical power-mod patterns.
- Algebra:
  - General forms of 1-variable and 2-variable linear equations.  
  - Simple steps for translating word problems.

This sheet becomes your quick-revision tool before full mocks and future weeks.

- Handle **remainder** and **last-digit** questions without full long division.
