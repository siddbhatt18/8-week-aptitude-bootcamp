Week 8 is your **integration + exam-simulation week**.  
Goal: shift from “learning topics” to **performing well on mixed tests**.

Assume ~**3 hours/day**. If you have less/more time, scale down/up number of questions, but keep the structure.

Overall pattern this week:

- Short warm-up  
- **Sectional tests** (Quant / LR / Verbal / DI) on some days  
- **1 full mock** on at least 2 days  
- Careful **error analysis + targeted revision** every day

---

## Day 1 – Baseline Mixed Sectionals (Where Do I Stand Now?)

**Main goal:** Get a clear picture of current strengths/weaknesses across sections.

### 1. Warm-up (15–20 min)

Do 1–2 very easy questions from each area:

- 1 simple arithmetic (percentage / ratio)  
- 1 short DI question  
- 1 LR (tiny seating or simple puzzle)  
- 1 RC question or short paragraph with 1–2 questions  
- 1 grammar error-spotting item

Do them casually, just to “wake up” your skills.

---

### 2. Sectional Test 1 – Quant (45–50 min)

Create/choose a **Quant-only test** (~20–25 questions), mixed from:

- Percentages / Ratios / Averages – 5–7 Q  
- Profit & Loss / SI / CI – 4–5 Q  
- Time–Speed–Distance / Trains / Boats – 4–5 Q  
- Time & Work / Pipes – 4–5 Q  
- Number Systems (LCM/HCF, factors, remainders) – 3–4 Q

Rules:

- Time: **45–50 minutes**, one sitting.  
- No checking answers mid-way.  
- Aim for **steady pace** (2–2.5 min per medium question; easier ones faster).

---

### 3. Sectional Test 2 – Verbal (30–35 min)

Create a **Verbal-only test** (~15–18 questions):

- RC:  
  - 1 passage with 4–6 Q  
- Grammar & Sentence Correction: 6–8 Q  
- Vocabulary/Fill-in-the-blanks: 4–5 Q  
- Optional: 1–2 Critical Reasoning questions

Time: **30–35 minutes**.

Focus on:
- Applying strategies learned (main idea, context clues, basic grammar rules).  
- Not overthinking every option; eliminate clearly wrong ones first.

---

### 4. Analysis Block (45–60 min)

Now check both sectionals.

For **Quant**:

- Count: attempted, correct, wrong.  
- For each wrong/slow question:
  - Label topic (e.g., TSD, P&L, Averages).  
  - Identify error type:
    - Concept gap  
    - Formula recall issue  
    - Calculation slip  
    - Misreading  
  - Re-solve cleanly. If concept is weak, note: “Need more practice: [topic]”.

For **Verbal**:

- For RC: Did you misinterpret passage, or fall for trap options?  
- For Grammar: Which rules came up most (S–V agreement, tenses, pronouns)?  
- For Vocab: Did you ignore context clues?

Create a simple **Week 8 Weakness List** (to update daily):

- Quant: topic → “level = weak/ok/strong”  
- Verbal: area → “RC inference weak”, “S–V good”, etc.

---

## Day 2 – LR + DI Focus + Targeted Quant/Verbal

**Main goal:** Test and refine Logical Reasoning and DI under light time pressure.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- 1 easy LR mini-puzzle (3–4 Q)  
- 2 small DI questions (from a simple table/bar graph)

Do quickly to get into a logical, data-reading mindset.

---

### 2. Sectional Test 3 – Logical Reasoning (35–40 min)

Prepare **~15 questions**:

- 1 linear arrangement set (4–5 Q)  
- 1 circular arrangement set (4–5 Q)  
- 1 grouping/selection puzzle set or simple logic grid (4–6 Q)

Time: **35–40 minutes**.

Focus:

- Drawing **clean diagrams**.  
- Avoiding messy case-explosions: if there are too many cases, you probably missed a stronger constraint.

---

### 3. Sectional Test 4 – Data Interpretation (35–40 min)

Prepare **3 DI sets**, ~12–15 Q total:

- 1 table set (4–5 Q)  
- 1 bar/line graph set (4–5 Q)  
- 1 pie chart set (4–5 Q)

Time: **35–40 minutes**.

Focus:

- Reading units / labels correctly.  
- Doing basic arithmetic fast but accurate (ratios, % changes, totals).

---

### 4. Targeted Practice Based on Day 1 Weakness (25–30 min)

From your **Weakness List (Day 1)** pick 1–2 topics from Quant or Verbal.

Example:
- If you found P&L and RC inference weak:

  - Do:
    - 5–7 additional P&L problems.  
    - 1 extra small RC passage (3–4 Q, focusing on inference).

Keep this block short and focused on the **exact patterns** that troubled you.

---

### 5. Analysis & Reflection (20–25 min)

Check LR & DI tests:

- LR:
  - For each wrong set, re-draw diagrams calmly.  
  - Ask: Did you misinterpret left/right? Miss a condition? Or give up early?

- DI:
  - Identify if errors came from:
    - Misreading graph/table  
    - Arithmetic  
    - Concept (e.g., % change vs % of total)

Update **Weakness List** with LR/DI weak areas (e.g., “circular outward-facing”, “pie-chart % questions”).

---

## Day 3 – Full Mock Test 1 (All Sections)

**Main goal:** Experience an exam-like paper with all topics mixed.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

Just 1–2 simple questions from each of:

- Quant  
- LR  
- DI  
- Verbal (RC or Grammar)

Don’t tire yourself; this is just warm-up.

---

### 2. Full Mock Test 1 (75–90 min)

Design (or pick from a placement mock):

Around **30–35 questions total**, mixed:

- Quant: 12–14 Q  
- DI: 6–8 Q  
- LR: 6–8 Q  
- Verbal: 8–10 Q

Time: **75–90 minutes**, depending on typical time of your target exams. If unsure, pick 90 minutes.

Rules:

- Simulate real exam: no phone, no pauses, no checking solutions.  
- Mark questions you are unsure about as you go.

Strategy:

- In the first 3–5 minutes, quickly scan the whole test to identify:
  - “Easy-looking” questions/sets.  
  - Very wordy/complex ones you might leave for later.

- Work in rounds:
  - Round 1: Solve all clearly easy/moderate questions.  
  - Round 2: Attempt the remaining ones if time left.

---

### 3. Mock Analysis (60–75 min)

This is the **most important part**:

1. **Score and basic stats**:
   - Attempted, correct, wrong, unattempted.  
   - Accuracy = correct / attempted.

2. **Section-wise performance**:
   - Quant – accuracy, time-feel.  
   - LR – any sets you left or messed up?  
   - DI – slow? misread questions?  
   - Verbal – more errors in RC, grammar, or vocab?

3. For **every wrong/guessed question**:
   - Re-solve without looking at answer.  
   - Then check solution.  
   - Write 1–2 lines:
     - What was the correct approach?  
     - Why was your previous approach wrong/inefficient?

4. Update your **Weakness List** again:
   - Mark topics that repeatedly appear as problematic.  
   - For example:
     - “TSD with average speed”  
     - “Circle arrangements with outward facing”  
     - “RC inference”  
     - “Grammar – pronoun reference”

---

### 4. Light Cool-down (10–15 min)

Do **2–3 easy problems** from your strongest area to end with a bit of confidence.

---

## Day 4 – Targeted Revision + Light Sectionals

**Main goal:** Use insights from Mock 1 to patch key weak spots; keep practice going without burning out.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

Do 3–4 **easy to moderate** questions from your **weakest topic** (from Weakness List).

Example:
- If “Time & Work multi-phase” is weak, do 3–4 of those.  
- If “RC main idea” is weak, do 1 short RC focused on main idea.

---

### 2. Targeted Revision Block 1 – Quant/LR (45–50 min)

Pick **1–2 weakest Quant/LR topics** from your list.

Examples:
- TSD + trains  
- Time & Work + Pipes  
- Circular arrangements  
- LCM/HCF + factors

Do:

- 10–12 questions in that area.  
- Write down shortcuts, patterns, and formulae next to problems you got wrong earlier.

You are not doing random practice—this is **surgical repair** on known weak spots.

---

### 3. Targeted Revision Block 2 – Verbal/DI (35–40 min)

Pick **1 Verbal weakness** and **1 DI weakness**.

Examples:
- RC inference + Pie-chart questions  
- Grammar S–V agreement + DI % change  
- Vocab in context + Table DI

Do:

- 1 RC passage OR 10–12 grammar/vocab questions (depending on your weakness).  
- 1 DI set (table/bar/line/pie) with 4–5 questions.

Aim for **accuracy and clarity**, not volume.

---

### 4. Mini Mixed Set – Timed (20–25 min)

Make a small, mixed set of ~10–12 questions:

- 4 Quant  
- 2 LR  
- 2 DI  
- 3–4 Verbal

Time: **20–25 min**.

This trains your brain to **switch types** under moderate time pressure.

---

### 5. Reflection (10–15 min)

Write:

- Are you noticing **improvement** in any weak area since earlier in week?  
- Is there any topic where you still feel “lost”? (If yes, plan to revisit theory/notes for that topic tomorrow.)

---

## Day 5 – Full Mock Test 2 (Refinement)

**Main goal:** Take another full mixed mock, apply lessons from Mock 1.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

Similar to Day 3:

- 1–2 easy Quant  
- 1 LR  
- 1 DI  
- 1 Verbal Q

Keep it light.

---

### 2. Full Mock Test 2 (75–90 min)

Another **30–35 question** full test, different from Mock 1 but same structure:

- Quant: 12–14 Q  
- DI: 6–8 Q  
- LR: 6–8 Q  
- Verbal: 8–10 Q

Time: **75–90 minutes**.

This time, consciously:

- Spend less time stuck on one tough question.  
- Apply any time-management tricks you noted from Mock 1.  
- Check if you can slightly improve speed without sacrificing accuracy.

---

### 3. Deep Analysis (60–75 min)

Repeat the **same thorough process** as Day 3:

- Score overall & section-wise.  
- For each error:
  - Re-solve → inspect solution → write mini-note.  
- Compare Mock 1 vs Mock 2:
  - Did accuracy improve?  
  - Did time pressure feel less?  
  - Are some weaknesses recurring? Those are **priority** now.

Update **Weakness List** again. Some issues may be fixed; some may remain:

- Cross out topics where you now feel strong.  
- Highlight repeated problem areas.

---

### 4. Light Revision (15–20 min)

End with a low-stress block:

- 5–7 easy/moderate questions from topics you are **already strong** in.  
- This keeps confidence up and prevents neglecting your strengths.

---

## Day 6 – Final Polishing: High-Yield Topics + Strategy

**Main goal:** Do high-yield revision + short timed practice; no more full mocks (to avoid burnout).

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

Pick your **single weakest area** (e.g., RC inference, circular arrangement, TSD average speed) and do:

- 3–5 quick questions just from that area.

---

### 2. High-Yield Quant & DI Revision (40–45 min)

High-yield topics for most placement tests:

- Percentages + Profit & Loss  
- Ratios + Averages  
- SI/CI basics  
- TSD OR Time & Work  
- Basic DI (especially tables/bar/pie)

Choose **3 of these** (preferably ones you’re moderately good at but want to make very reliable) and:

- Do 2–3 questions from each (total ~8–10).  
- Quickly revisit key formulas and shortcuts for each.

Goal: make sure you **don’t drop easy marks** on these in the real test.

---

### 3. High-Yield Verbal & LR Revision (35–40 min)

High-yield verbal/LR areas:

- RC: main idea + basic inference  
- Grammar: S–V agreement, tenses, pronouns  
- Basic vocab-in-context  
- LR: 1 linear arrangement + 1 circular arrangement

Do:

- 1 short RC (3–4 Q).  
- 8–10 grammar/vocab Qs.  
- 1 LR arrangement set (4–5 Q).

Focus on **clean logic** and **clear reading**, not trick questions.

---

### 4. Short Timed Mixed Test (20–25 min)

Construct a **mini test** of ~12–15 Q:

- 4 Quant  
- 3 DI  
- 3 LR  
- 3–4 Verbal

Time: **20–25 min**.

Use this to:

- Practice switching context quickly.  
- Apply all your time management and skipping strategies.

---

### 5. Strategy Reflection (15–20 min)

Write clearly:

1. In the real exam, **which section will you attempt first? second?** Why?  
2. How much time will you roughly allocate to:
   - Quant  
   - DI  
   - LR  
   - Verbal  
   (if your real exam has a known format, adjust to that.)

3. What will you do if:
   - First 2 questions look very hard?  
   - You get stuck for 3+ minutes on a single question?  
   - You feel nervous or blank for a moment?

Have a **simple plan** (e.g., “skip and mark after 2.5 minutes, move on.”)

---

## Day 7 – Light Simulation + Big-Picture Review

**Main goal:** Light simulation, confidence boost, and final consolidation. Do not exhaust yourself.

### 1. Very Light Warm-up (10–15 min)

1–2 very easy questions from:

- Quant  
- Verbal  
- LR or DI

Just to feel “warmed up”, not tired.

---

### 2. Final Mini Simulated Test (35–45 min)

Make a **20-question mini paper**:

- Quant: 6 Q  
- DI: 4 Q  
- LR: 4 Q  
- Verbal: 6 Q

Time: **35–45 min**.

Aim:
- Stay calm.  
- Follow your skipping/time strategy.  
- Focus on accuracy, not pushing speed aggressively.

---

### 3. Quick Check (20–25 min)

Check answers:

- Count correct, wrong, unattempted.  
- For any error, briefly note type (concept, careless, misread).

Don’t do a very deep analysis today—just enough to remain aware.

---

### 4. Big-Picture Review (30–40 min)

Open your notebook where you’ve been writing:

- Week 8 Weakness List  
- Mistake logs from mocks  
- Key formulas/notes

Do a **scan review**:

1. Skim all key formulas:
   - Percentages, ratios, averages, P&L, SI/CI  
   - TSD, Time & Work, Pipes  
   - Basic Number Systems (LCM/HCF, factors, remainders)  
   - DI tricks (totals, % change)  
   - LR patterns  
   - RC + grammar “rules of thumb”

2. Re-read your **mistake logs**, ask:
   - Are there patterns I must remember to avoid (e.g., misreading units, confusing left/right)?

3. If any concept still feels fuzzy, mentally rehearse at least:
   - “In such questions, I will do THIS first.”

---

### 5. Final Reflection (15–20 min)

Write a short summary for yourself:

1. **Top 3 strengths** (topics or sections where you are comfortable).  
2. **Top 3 weaknesses**, but also what you’ll do during exam to manage them  
   (e.g., “If long RC passage seems too tough, I’ll skip it and do grammar first.”).

3. Your **mental rules**:
   - “No question gets more than 3 minutes unless very close to answer.”  
   - “Always read DI units carefully.”  
   - “Underline ‘not/except’ in questions.”  
   - “For RC, always find main idea first.”

4. One positive sentence for yourself:
   - “I have practiced the core topics; now it’s about staying calm and applying what I know.”

---

You now have:

- 7 weeks of topic learning  
- 1 week of integration, mocks, and strategy

At this point, additional improvement comes from:

- Regular short mixed practice  
- Occasional full mocks  
- Focused revision of your personal weak patterns

If you tell me which **specific company/exam** you’re targeting (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc.), I can suggest how to adapt this final week to that exam’s pattern (number of questions, sections, negative marking, etc.).
