Here is a structured **Day 1–Day 7 plan for Week 8**, focused on:

- Full and sectional **mocks**  
- **Revision and error-fixing** of all key topics  
- Building **exam strategy** (question selection, timing, accuracy)

Target: **2–3 hours per day** if possible. If you have less time, you can trim the number of questions but keep the same structure.

Assume you now know basics of:
- Arithmetic (Weeks 1–4)
- DI (Week 5)
- Algebra/word problems (Week 6)
- LR (Week 7)

---

## Overall Goals for Week 8

1. Practice **test-like mock papers** (sectional + full length).  
2. Identify **patterns of mistakes** and plug conceptual gaps.  
3. Improve **speed & decision-making** (which questions to attempt/skip).  

All days follow a general pattern:
- Short warm-up  
- One main test (sectional or full)  
- Deep review and targeted drills

---

## Day 1 – Arithmetic Sectional Test + Revision

### 1. Warm-up (20–25 min)

- Quick revision of formulas:
  - Percentages, profit & loss, SI  
  - Ratios, averages  
  - Time & work, time–speed–distance

Do 6–8 warm-up questions (2 each from %/P&L, avgs/ratio, T&W/TSD) just to get back into flow.

### 2. Arithmetic Sectional Test (45–60 min)

- Create or pick a **sectional test** with **20–25 arithmetic questions**, mixed from:
  - Percentages & ratios  
  - Averages, P&L, SI  
  - Time & work, pipes  
  - TSD, trains, boats  
  - Simple algebra/ages/mixtures

Simulate test conditions:
- Time limit: **45 minutes**.  
- Don’t get stuck: if any Q takes > 2 minutes with no progress, mark and move on.

### 3. Detailed Review (45–60 min)

For each question:

- Mark as:
  - C-F (Correct & fast)  
  - C-S (Correct but slow)  
  - W (Wrong)  
  - N (Not attempted)

For C-S, W, N:
- Re-solve without time pressure.  
- Identify error category:
  - Concept gap (don’t know method)  
  - Misread / skipped detail  
  - Calculation error  
  - Time management (spent too long)

Make a short list:
- 3 topics where you made most mistakes (e.g., “TSD + trains”, “mixtures”, “P&L backwards problems”).  

### 4. Targeted Drill (20–30 min)

Pick **your weakest 1–2 arithmetic topics from this test** and solve:

- 5–8 focused questions for each weak topic.

---

## Day 2 – DI Sectional Test + Revision

### 1. Warm-up (15–20 min)

- 4–6 questions:
  - 2 on % change  
  - 2 on ratio/average  
  - 1–2 simple table DI questions

### 2. DI Sectional Test (45–60 min)

Choose **3–4 DI sets** (tables / bar / line / pie, mixed if possible), total around **15–20 questions**.

- Give yourself **45–50 minutes**.  
- Quickly scan all sets first (2–3 minutes).  
- Start with the set that looks:
  - Numerically simple  
  - With more direct questions (totals, simple %)

Focus on:
- Reading data carefully once.  
- Writing minimal but clear rough work.

### 3. Detailed Review (40–50 min)

Check each question:

- For wrong/slow ones, ask:
  - Did you misread a label/axis/legend?  
  - Was it a calculation-heavy Q that you should have skipped initially?  
  - Was there a shortcut (like ratio/approximation) you missed?

Note per set:
- Which set was easiest/hardest? Why? (data type, operations, or presentation)

### 4. Targeted Drill (20–30 min)

Pick **2 DI sets** that match your weak style:
- If pie charts were tough → 2 more pie sets.  
- If tables with % changes were tough → 2 such sets.

Solve them in **timed mode (10–12 min per set)**.

---

## Day 3 – LR Sectional Test + Syllogism/Arrangement Focus

### 1. Warm-up (15–20 min)

Solve:
- 1 short linear arrangement  
- 1 short circular arrangement  
- 2–3 syllogisms

This reactivates your LR “diagram mode”.

### 2. LR Sectional Test (45–60 min)

Pick a **set of 20–25 LR questions**, with:
- 8–10 arrangement/ordering (linear + circular)  
- 4–6 assignment/selection puzzles  
- 6–8 syllogisms / logical deductions / coding-decoding if present in your exam pattern

Time: **45–50 minutes**.

Exam strategy:
- First skim all questions in 2–3 min.  
- Start with:
  - Small standalone questions (syllogism, directions, blood relations if any).  
  - Then **one** arrangement puzzle that looks most structured/clear.  
- Don’t force yourself to finish every tough puzzle; it’s okay to move on.

### 3. Detailed Review (40–50 min)

- For each wrong/slow puzzle:
  - Redraw solution neatly.  
  - Identify at which clue/step you went wrong.  
  - Check if you can create a better organizing method (table, improved diagram, marking).

For syllogisms:
- See if error was due to **over-assumption** or missing a possible diagram.

### 4. Targeted Drill (20–30 min)

Based on the test:
- If arrangements were weak → solve 2 more arrangement sets (with full diagrams).  
- If syllogisms were weak → do 10–15 more syllogism Qs.

---

## Day 4 – Full-Length Mock (Aptitude Only) – 1

### 1. Light Warm-up (15–20 min)

- 4–6 easy questions (mix of arithmetic, DI, LR) just to warm up:
  - 2 arithmetic  
  - 2 DI  
  - 2 LR

### 2. Full Aptitude Mock Test (60–75 min)

Pick a **full-length aptitude-style mock** resembling your target exam:

- Total: **30–40 questions** (or your exam’s typical count)  
- Mix: Arithmetic + DI + LR + basic algebra

Time: **60–75 minutes** depending on pattern.

During test:
- Spend first minute skimming to see section balance.  
- Rough target:  
  - Solve all “easy and medium” questions first.  
  - If you’re stuck > 2–2.5 min, mark and move on.  
- Try to aim for **75–80% accuracy** rather than solving everything.

### 3. In-Depth Analysis (60–75 min)

This is the **most important part**:

- Categorize each question:
  - Attempted & correct  
  - Attempted & wrong  
  - Not attempted

For each **wrong or skipped** question:
- Identify:  
  - Topic (P&L, TSD, DI bar graph, LR arrangement, etc.).  
  - Root cause:
    - Didn’t know concept/method  
    - Misread data or question  
    - Knew method but did calculation error  
    - Ran out of time

Write a “post-mortem” summary:
- Which 2–3 topics cost you the most marks?  
- Which type of question should you skip earlier next time (e.g., very heavy calculation DI, very complex LR puzzle)?

### 4. Micro-Drill (20–30 min)

From this mock:
- Take **5–8 questions** that you got wrong or didn’t attempt but are **important/common types**.  
- Re-solve them fully, slowly, and write clean solutions in your notebook.

---

## Day 5 – Focused Weak-Area Day + Light Mixed Practice

### 1. Identify Weak Areas (10–15 min)

From Days 1–4 analysis, list top **2–3 weak areas**, e.g.:

- Example:
  - TSD & trains  
  - DI pie charts with year-to-year changes  
  - LR circular arrangements

### 2. Targeted Practice Block 1 (45–60 min)

Choose **1 major weak topic** and do:

- 12–15 questions on that single topic.  
  - E.g., only “Trains” or only “Mixtures” or only “Circular arrangements”.

Use a timer but focus more on **accuracy and pattern recognition**.

### 3. Targeted Practice Block 2 (30–40 min)

Choose **another weak topic** and do:

- 8–12 questions on that topic.

Example:
- 2 DI sets on pie charts.  
- 2–3 LR puzzles if LR is weak.

### 4. Light Mixed Set (20–30 min)

Finish with:
- 8–10 mixed questions covering topics you’re already decent at (just to retain fluency).

---

## Day 6 – Full-Length Mock (Aptitude Only) – 2

### 1. Light Warm-up (10–15 min)

- 3–4 super-easy questions (don’t tire yourself):  
  - 1 arithmetic  
  - 1 DI  
  - 1–2 LR/syllogisms

### 2. Full Mock Test (60–75 min)

Take another **full-length aptitude mock**, similar structure to Day 4:

- 30–40 questions (or your exam pattern)  
- Time: 60–75 minutes

This time, implement **lessons from Day 4**:
- Change question selection strategy if needed:
  - Example: do LR first if you’re stronger there; or  
  - Leave heavy DI sets for last.  
- Keep an eye on:
  - Time spent per section  
  - How early you spot and skip potential time-wasters

### 3. Compare & Analyze (60–75 min)

- Compare Mock 1 vs Mock 2:
  - Score  
  - Accuracy  
  - Areas of improvement

- Go through Mock 2 in detail:
  - Same C-F, C-S, W, N categorization.  
  - Note if previous weak areas improved or still problem.

Write 3–5 bullet points:
- “Strategy improvements that worked”  
- “Things still hurting my performance (e.g., silly mistakes, rushing, not reading whole question)”

### 4. Short Targeted Drill (15–20 min)

- Pick **just 1** major persistent weakness and solve 5–8 handpicked questions to reinforce the right method.

---

## Day 7 – Final Consolidation + Light Mock + Strategy Lock-in

### 1. High-Level Revision (30–40 min)

Skim your notes and mistake book:

- Formulas & key shortcuts for:
  - % / Ratio / Average / P&L / SI  
  - T&W / TSD / Trains / Boats  
  - DI patterns  
  - Common algebra/word-problem templates  
  - LR arrangement basics & syllogism patterns

For each major area, mentally recall or quickly redo **1 representative question**.

### 2. Short Mixed Mock (30–40 min)

Take a **lighter mock** to avoid burnout:

- 20–25 questions (all topics mixed)  
- Time: 30–40 minutes

Focus on:
- Calm, error-free solving  
- Applying your final strategy (order of sections, how long before you skip, etc.)  
- Not panicking if 1–2 questions look strange

### 3. Final Review (20–30 min)

Check answers and:
- Make sure silly mistakes are minimal.  
- Note **last-minute reminders** like:
  - “Write key data clearly for DI.”  
  - “Always convert km/hr to m/s carefully in trains.”  
  - “Draw diagram for LR; don’t keep in your head.”  
  - “Translate age/word problems step-by-step; don’t skip.”

### 4. Strategy Summary (15–20 min)

Write your personal **Exam Strategy Sheet** (1–2 pages):

- Order of attempting sections (e.g., LR → Arithmetic → DI, or any order that fits you).  
- Time budget per section (for a 60-minute test, e.g., 20–20–20).  
- Rules for skipping:
  - “If no progress in 2 minutes, mark & move on.”  
- Mental checklists:
  - For arithmetic: check units, re-read question before final answer.  
  - For DI: check if question asks for % of A over B or B over A.  
  - For LR: verify all clues used.

Keep this sheet handy before any actual test.

If you tell me your **target exam** (e.g., TCS NQT / Infosys / Wipro / Accenture / Cognizant / product-based tests), I can suggest:
- Ideal target number of questions to attempt in a mock  
- Recommended difficulty level of mocks  
- Any topic to emphasize slightly more in this Week 8 plan.
