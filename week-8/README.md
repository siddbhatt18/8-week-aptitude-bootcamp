Here’s your **Week 8 (Day 1–7) plan**, focused on:

- Full / near-full mock tests  
- Refining test-taking strategy  
- Tightening weak areas only (no new topics)  

Assume **2–3 hours/day**. If you have less, reduce review quantity but do not skip review entirely.

You’ll cycle through:
1. Timed mock or sectional test  
2. Deep review and error analysis  
3. Short, focused reinforcement on weak patterns  

---

## Overall Goals for Week 8

By the end of this week, you should:

- Be comfortable solving **mixed aptitude questions under time pressure**.  
- Know your **strong/medium/weak** topic clusters and plan the order you attempt them.  
- Have a clear, repeatable strategy for the real online assessment.

---

## Day 1 – Full Quant + DI/LR Mock #1

### 1. Full Mock Test (Quant-Focused) – 60–75 min

Create or choose a mock with **35–40 questions** including:

- Arithmetic (Percent, Ratio, Average, PLD, SI): 10–12 Q  
- Work & Distance (TSD, Time & Work, Pipes, simple Mixtures): 8–10 Q  
- Number System & Algebra (LCM/HCF, Remainders, Equations, Mixtures): 6–8 Q  
- DI (tables/bar/pie/line): 6–8 Q  
- LR/P&C/Probability basics: 4–6 Q  

Time: **60–75 minutes** depending on mock difficulty.

Use your Week 7 strategy:
- First pass: 25–30 minutes → easy & medium questions only, skip anything that feels heavy or unclear in 30–45 seconds.  
- Second pass: Use remaining time for marked questions where you now see a path.

### 2. Deep Review (45–60 min)

For this full mock, be very systematic:

- Make a 4-column log:  
  - Q#, Topic, Status (Correct/Incorrect/Skipped), Reason for issue.
- For all incorrect/skipped and any that took >3 min:
  - Label the cause:
    1. Concept gap  
    2. Misinterpretation / rushed reading  
    3. Calculation/approximation mistake  
    4. Time mismanagement (stuck too long)

Pick **8–10 representative questions** (2–3 from each cause type) and:
- Re-solve them slowly, writing the “ideal” approach.

### 3. Mini-Drill (15–20 min)

From today’s analysis, pick your **top 1–2 weak patterns** (e.g., remainders, alligation, relative speed, seating).

- Do **5–8 fresh questions** only from those types, untimed but with correct method.

---

## Day 2 – Targeted Sectionals (Two Focused Tests)

### 1. Sectional Test 1 – Arithmetic + Business Math (30–35 min)

Make a set of **18–20 questions**:

- Percentages & Ratios: 5–7 Q  
- Averages & Mixtures/Alligation: 4–5 Q  
- Profit–Loss–Discount & SI: 5–7 Q  

Time: **30–35 minutes**.

Focus:
- Recognize pattern quickly (“successive %”, “weighted average”, etc.).  
- Aim ~80% accuracy.

### 2. Quick Review (20–25 min)

- For each wrong/slow Q:  
  - Identify if it was formula confusion or setup confusion.  
- Re-solve 4–5 questions where your approach was long; search for shorter solution patterns (ratio approach vs full equations, etc.).

### 3. Sectional Test 2 – Work & Distance + Number System (30–35 min)

Make **18–20 questions**:

- TSD / Boats & Streams / Average speed: 5–7 Q  
- Time & Work / Pipes: 5–7 Q  
- Number System (LCM/HCF, Remainders/Last digit): 4–6 Q  

Time: **30–35 minutes**.

Focus:
- Use correct template:
  - “Relative speed” / “Work rate” / “Remainder cycle”.

### 4. Review (20–25 min)

- Tag the most common pattern of mistakes:
  - Wrong unit conversion?  
  - Mis-handling of rates?  
  - Remainder cycle misjudged?

Do **3–5 more questions** on the single worst-pattern for the day.

---

## Day 3 – DI + LR + P&C/Probability Day

### 1. DI + LR Mini-Mock (40–45 min)

Create a test of **20–24 questions**:

- DI: 12–15 Q
  - Include at least 3 different types (table, bar, pie, line).  
- LR: 6–8 Q
  - 1 seating arrangement + 1 distribution/assignment type puzzle.

Time: **40–45 minutes**.

Strategy:
- Start with easiest-looking DI (often tables/bar).  
- Move to LR puzzles next. If a puzzle seems messy after 2–3 minutes, park it and return later.

### 2. Review (30–35 min)

- For DI errors:
  - Was the error in reading data or in % / ratio calculation?  
- For LR:
  - Was your initial diagram structure flawed?  
  - Did you try to solve too much mentally without writing a table/row?

Redraw at least **one LR puzzle** cleanly and re-solve from scratch.

### 3. P&C + Probability Top-Up (20–25 min)

Do a **small focused set of 8–10 questions**:

- 4–5 P&C (arrangements vs combinations, simple constraints).  
- 4–5 Probability (coins/dice, basic selection from a group).

Don’t go for very tricky ones; aim for mastery of common patterns.

---

## Day 4 – Full Quant + DI/LR Mock #2 (Different Order Strategy)

### 1. Full Mock Test #2 (60–75 min)

Similar to Day 1: **35–40 questions**, but:

- This time, **change the order** you attempt sections.  
  - Example: Start with DI (if you’re now comfortable there), then Arithmetic, then Work/Distance, then the rest.  
- Time again: **60–75 minutes**.

Purpose:
- See if a different starting point affects confidence and score.

### 2. Performance Comparison & Review (45–60 min)

Compare Mock #1 and Mock #2:

- Accuracy (%) and attempts.  
- Which order felt better mentally?  
- In which test did you waste more time on hard questions?

Then:
- Analyze Mock #2 questions similarly (cause tags).  
- Re-solve 6–8 of the highest-leverage ones (those that represent recurring mistakes).

### 3. Focused Quick Drill (10–15 min)

From both mocks, list **3 topics** where you made repeated mistakes.

- Do **2–3 questions per topic** (6–9 in total) to stabilise them.

---

## Day 5 – “Exam Simulation” Day (Stick to a Fixed Strategy)

### 1. Pre-Exam Routine (10–15 min)

Before test:
- Quickly skim your summarized formula sheets (Weeks 1–7).  
- Set a **clear plan on paper**:
  - Order of topics/sections.
  - Target attempts (e.g., “I’ll aim to attempt 28+ out of 35 with 80%+ accuracy”).

### 2. Full Mock Test #3 (60–75 min)

Now treat this as your “real exam rehearsal”.

- Same structure: ~35–40 questions, mixed.  
- Stick to the **order and rules you decided**:
  - Max 90–120 seconds on first look; skip if stuck.  
  - No changing the plan mid-way unless absolutely necessary.

### 3. Post-Test Reflection (45–60 min)

- Did you follow your strategy or panic and deviate?  
- Where did you spend most time? (Try to estimate section-by-section.)

Analyze all errors again, but now:
- Focus more on **test-taking behaviour** than pure concept:
  - Did you ignore an obviously easy question later in the paper?  
  - Did you spend 5 minutes on a 2-mark tricky one?

Re-solve only the **questions you should reasonably have got** in an exam; ignore overly complex or out-of-scope ones.

---

## Day 6 – Light Practice + High-Yield Revision

Today is lighter to avoid burnout and to consolidate.

### 1. High-Yield Topic Drill (35–40 min)

From your error logs across Weeks 7–8, identify your **top 3 scoring topics** (where you’re okay but can still improve speed):

Examples:
- Percent + Ratio + Average.  
- TSD + Time & Work.  
- DI Tables/Bar.

For each chosen area:
- Do **5–7 medium-level questions** (15–20 total).  
- Focus on:
  - Clean setups,  
  - Avoiding re-calculation,  
  - Using mental math/shortcuts where safe.

### 2. Very Short Sectional (15–20 min)

Do a **mini-test of 10–12 mixed questions**:
- Put a hard stop at 15–20 min.  
- Aim for **high accuracy** rather than max attempts.

### 3. Consolidated Revision (30–40 min)

Take out all your summary sheets from previous weeks (1–7):

- Re-read:
  - Key formulas.  
  - Typical patterns (e.g., replacement formula in mixtures, net % change formula, remainder tricks).  
  - LR/DI approaches.

If something still feels fuzzy, solve 1 quick example per fuzzy formula/type.

---

## Day 7 – Final Mock + Exam-Day Blueprint

### 1. Final Full Mock Test #4 (60–75 min)

- Same structure: **35–40 mixed questions**, 60–75 min.  
- Use your **best strategy** discovered (order + skipping rules).  
- Treat this as close to real exam conditions:
  - No phones, no pausing.  
  - Only pen, paper, and allowed tools.

### 2. Final Performance Review (40–50 min)

- Write down for this final mock:
  - Total attempts, correct, accuracy%.  
  - By topic group (Arithmetic / Work-Distance / Number System-Algebra / DI / LR / P&C-Prob).

Identify:
- Topics where you’re now consistently strong → attempt early in real test.  
- Topics that are risky → do only if plenty of time remains.

Don’t get bogged down in minor mistakes now; the goal is pattern clarity.

### 3. Exam-Day Blueprint (20–30 min)

On a page, write your **final plan** for real tests:

1. **Order of Attempt**  
   Example:
   - 1) Arithmetic (easy %/ratio/avg/PLD/SI)  
   - 2) TSD & Time & Work  
   - 3) DI Tables/Bar  
   - 4) Remaining Algebra/Number System  
   - 5) P&C/Probability & harder LR

2. **Time Allocation**  
   Example for 60-min quant/DI/LR section:
   - First 20 min: Easy arithmetic + easy TSD/Work.  
   - Next 20 min: DI sets + remaining moderate arithmetic.  
   - Last 20 min: P&C/Prob, LR, any leftover questions.

3. **Rules You Will Follow**  
   - If stuck >90 sec with no progress → skip and mark.  
   - If a question requires heavy calculation with ugly numbers → check options for approximation opportunities.  
   - Always read DI/LR questions before digging into the data.

Keep this blueprint and skim it before any real OA.

## By the End of Week 8

You should have:

- 4 full mixed mocks done under near-real conditions.  
- Clear awareness of:
  - Which topics are your “quick marks,”  
  - Which are “medium,”  
  - Which are “only if time permits.”

And you’ll have:

- A practiced attempt order,  
- A sense of pacing (how many questions roughly every 10–15 minutes),  
- Confidence in handling the majority of common placement aptitude questions.

If you share which specific company tests you’re sitting for (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc.), I can help you adapt this blueprint to their exact pattern (number of questions, time, sectional cutoffs).
